The MZ and MZ silage (MZS) had higher crude protein, starch and ether extract contents than both sorghum forages and sorghum silages. HS had higher ash and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations than FS and MZ. MZ, MZS, HS and HS silage (HSS) had lower neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and acid detergent lignin than FS and FS silage (FSS). FSS had higher dry matter (DM) and pH than MZS and HSS. HSS contained higher concentrations of P and K than FSS and MZS. MZS and HSS had higher in vitro dry matter and organic matter digestibility, CH4 production, total volatile fatty acids, acetate and propionate than FSS. pH was higher for FSS than for HSS, and ammonia was lower for HSS than for MZS and FSS. HSS had higher gas production than MZS and FSS after 2, 4, 6 and 8 h incubation. MZS had higher gas production than HSS and FSS after 26 and 28 h of incubation. The results indicate that HS may substitute for MZ to make good quality silage. However, animal studies are needed to assess the acceptability and feeding values of HSS vs. MZS for ruminant production.	high sugar forage sorghum, maize silage, digestibility, methane, gas production	2016-01-01 00:00:00

However, the optimal combination and the associative effects of SS and AF for ensilage have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the fermentation characteristic and nutritive value of silage mixtures with six different SS to AF ratios. The two forages were ensiled in air free silos for 150 days at room temperature as mixtures containing 0:100, 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, and 100:0 of SS:AF on a fresh weight basis. As the proportion of SS increased in silage, the content of ash, crude protein, saponins, ammonia, acetic acid, propionic acid and pH decreased, while neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber in organic matter, acid detergent lignin, water-soluble carbohydrate, starch, total phenolics and condensed tannins content increased. The silages were evaluated in 24-h incubations with rumen liquor. The in vitro rumen degradability of dry matter and organic matter as well as gas production, pH, ammonia, total volatile fatty acids and methane decreased as the proportion of SS increased in the silage mixtures. This study suggests that high quality silages can be made with SS:AF ratios of 20:80 and 40:60. These silage mixtures offer an opportunity to optimize the nutrient supply for ruminant production.

Water and sediment samples from the same sites were also analysed for these pesticides by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Out of nine investigated pesticides, only three pesticides (deltamethrin, carbofuran and cypermethrin) were detected in fish and sediment samples. Deltamethrin in Cyprinus carpio ranged from 0.490 to 0.839 μg/g, mostly exceeding 0.5 μg/g as the maximum residual limit suggested by FAO-WHO, whereas it ranged from 0.214 to 0.318 μg/g in the sampled sediments. The carbofuran concentrations were 0.0425–0.066 and 0.613–0.946 μg/g in Labeo rohita and Channa marulius muscles respectively and 0.069–0.081 μg/g in the corresponding sediment samples. These values were either higher or lower than the maximum limit (0.1 μg/g) as suggested by FAO-WHO. Conversely, the cypermethrin concentration ranged from 0.141 to 0.174 in Ch. marulius and 0.183–0.197 μg/g in sediments which were both below the FAO-WHO maximum limit of 2 μg/g. No pesticide residues were detected in water from these sampling sites. Most selected physicochemical variables were within the acceptable range of World Health Organization for the water quality for aquatic life. The detected pesticide contents were mostly higher in fish muscles from heavily polluted sites. This is worrying because these pesticides may pose health risks for the fish and people of the study area. However, a preliminary risk assessment indicated that the calculated daily intake of detected pesticides by people consuming fish from the Indus River was low and did not present an immediate risk to the fish-consuming people. This study may be used as a benchmark to determine the safety of fish meat in order to develop intervention strategies to maintain the water quality and to protect the health of fish and fish-consuming people.

For this, C. mrigala was netted from three variably polluted downstream sites (B, C and D) and one less polluted upstream site (A). The fish was sampled during low (winter) and high (post monsoon) river flow seasons. The fish muscles from site D showed 28 % less total carbohydrates than the fish caught from site A. The muscle carbohydrate contents were further decreased at sites B and C by 58 and 59 % and 77 and 74 %, during low and high flows, respectively. Moreover, total lipids, cholesterol and RNA contents for the muscle of the fish from the downstream locations were also decreased up to 29, 68 and 58 %, respectively. Conversely, total protein, soluble protein and DNA contents were increased in fish muscles progressively downstream during both the low- and high-flow seasons. It appeared that the fish muscle components can change with the level of water pollution which may affect the fish attributes as a safe food.

The treatments included an untreated control (C), a microbial inoculant (I), NaOH, CaO and NaOH plus inoculant (NaOH + I). Inoculant was grown anaerobically, using a starter culture of rumen fluid from cattle given Rhodes grass. Treatments C, I, NaOH, NaOH + I, were offered separately to twelve dairy heifers, in a 3 ✕ 4 randomized complete block design, repeated twice for each grass silage. C and I had substantial mould growth, compared with no visible mould in NaOH or NaOH + I. CaO treatment was effective in preventing mould growth, but had little effect on the chemical composition and in sacco digestibility of mature grass silage. NaOH reduced NDF content and increased in sacco digestibility (P < 0·05) but not the in vivo digestibility (P > 0·05) of both mature- and young-grass silage. The effects of other treatments on nutritive value were non-significant at both stages of maturity. NaOH increased the intake of mature-grass silage by 24-26% (P < 0·05), but had little effect on the intake of young-grass silage (P > 0·05). Treatment I consistently reduced grass silage intake (P < 0·05) for young-grass silage. The findings of these studies show that treating mature Rhodes grass with NaOH will improve its nutritive value and reduce mould growth in conserved herbage. However none of the treatments in this study had any consistently positive effects on the in vivo nutritive value or storage quality of young-grass silage.	alkalis, Chloris gayana, heifers, inoculation, silage	2013-11-01 00:00:00

Environmental Monitoring and Assessment	School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK	abdul.chaudhry@newcastle.ac.uk	The river Ravi, while passing through Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan, gets highly polluted owning heavy loads of untreated municipal sewage and industrial effluents of diverse kinds. The fish, Catla catla sampled in two different seasons from three downstream polluted sites were compared with the samples of the same fish from an upstream, a less polluted site, for their physico-chemical parameters. The data were statistically analysed to study the effect of sites, seasons and their interaction on the physico-chemical parameters of waters and mineral uptake in fish muscles. Significant differences (P < 0.001) among the sampling sites and seasons were observed. The river appeared to be polluted as indicated by the high values of total suspended solids (909 mg/l) and sulphate (964 mg/l) in comparison to the respective values of 150 and 600 mg/l being suggested as the safer values of drinking water of the National Environmental Quality Standards. Most trace and macro elements in fish muscles were increased with the increasing pollution loads from the upstream to the downstream sites of this river. The remarkable increases in the levels of all the investigated minerals in fish muscles from the polluted sites raise concerns about the long-term health of the river Ravi ecosystem and consequently the fish and its consumer's health. The results contradict the opinion of the local population that the riverine fish are natural, more health-promoting and precious than the pond fish. Therefore, we strongly argue for the utilization of an effect-based monitoring approach to alleviate the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities on fish and the fish consumers' health.

I. Mohamed	Using fistulated sheep to compare in sacco and in vitro rumen degradation of selected feeds	Animal Production Science	School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK	abdul.chaudhry@ncl.ac.uk	Despite its beneficial role in almost all feed evaluation systems, the in sacco method is inconsistent and labour intensive in estimating the degradation of ruminant feeds. This study compared a rumen fluid-based in vitro method with the in sacco method to estimate degradation of 12 feeds comprising six concentrates and six grasses representing three fields during two seasons of winter and spring. Three feed groups (n = 4) were formed by using two grasses (one per season) and two concentrates. These feeds were incubated alongside blanks, in duplicate, for various hours either in sacco in three fistulated sheep or in vitro by using rumen fluid from the same sheep over three periods using two separate 3 × 3 Latin square designs. The in sacco and in vitro data were statistically compared for the effects of sheep, feed group and period on degradation at each incubation time within each method. The degradation data were fitted exponentially to derive water soluble (a), insoluble (b) and degradation rate (c) constants to estimate effective degradability at rumen outflow rate of 0.02 (P0.02) for each feed in each method. These values were statistically compared for variations within and between feed types for each method. The sheep, group and period did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) for feed degradation at most incubation times within any of these two methods. The in vitro method was able to mimic the in sacco degradation of feeds, although the absolute in vitro values were always lower than the in sacco values. The higher in sacco degradation for almost all feeds were partly attributed to the much greater losses of these feeds during their washing with water at 0 h. The in vitro method did identify significant differences (P < 0.05) in dry matter or crude protein degradations between and within different concentrates and grasses in parallel to the in sacco method. The ranking of feeds was comparable for these methods. The in vitro method can be used in parallel to the in sacco method to estimate degradation of various feeds. However, there is a need for coordinated studies to improve the prediction ability of the in vitro method for its adoption to routinely estimate the degradation of ruminant feeds.	concentrate, feed evaluation, grass, laboratory methods, ruminant	2011-01-01 00:00:00

The Mn, Pb, Cu, Zn, Hg, and Cr levels in water, gills, liver, muscles, and skin of these fish were compared with the international permissible levels. All metals except Pb and Hg in water were within the acceptable limits of drinking water. In contrast, the Mn, Hg, and Cr levels in the fish tissues were higher than their permissible limits for fish as a human food. Here, the gills contained higher metals than the other tissues. Different patterns of biomarkers were found in fish from these sites. While the gills did not show four protein bands (55, 30, 18.4, and 16.4 kDa), the muscles showed four new protein bands (100, 85, 45, and 20 kDa) for fish from the medium and high polluted sites as compared to the reference or low polluted site. The fish from the CH and SK sites of the Indus River contained low molecular weight DNA in their gills but high molecular weight DNA in their muscles when compared with the KW site. This study suggests that the proteins and DNA profiles of L. rohita could be used as biomarkers to assess the impact of potential environmental stressors such as metals on the freshwater systems.

Results show that knowledge workers in the private sector relied heavily on company sources, social media, and websites for information gathering. They saved information for future use in electronic folders, added favourites and bookmarks in their Internet browsers, and saved URLs of websites in other personal records. Knowledge workers organized digital documents using different work-related categories and regularly updated these folders. The most frequently used means to re-find information included searching by file names and accessing information through bookmarks. They considered the following means important with regard to information literacy at work: personal information management (PIM) tools, e-mail organizers, and personal networks. This study provides initial insight into an enhanced understanding of the factors influencing information management behaviour of corporate professionals, to suggest ways to refine these skills in order to take full advantage of the availability of digital information.

Survey of information finding practices of professionals in Kuwaiti companies showed that use of web sites, internal reports, and consulting with colleagues were preferred approaches for finding work related information. Business professionals also frequently used organizational sites, reports from financial analysts, business information services, and social media in seeking information. They listed lack of adequate information in databases and non-availability of information related to local financial situation as barriers to effective information finding. They considered their information finding skills as reasonable but wanted to get more training in searching online databases and web-based sources.

This paper reviews practices adopted by doctors in Kuwait for capturing, sharing, and generating knowledge. It also discusses the perceived impact of KM practices on performance of hospitals. Based on a survey of 277 doctors, the study found that KM practices among doctors in the sampled hospitals were not very effective. Little attention was paid to the main activities that support the transfer of expertise among doctors in hospitals. However, as predicted by previous studies, good km practices were perceived by doctors to have a positive impact on performance of hospitals.

Knowledge workers perform a variety of activities on personal networks to strengthen knowledge management. However, a review of these activities indicates that there is a need to place more emphasis on collaborative learning through social bookmarks, reflecting and commenting on blogs, and editing wikis to provide effective support for knowledge management.

The paper also reflects on issues related to readings and e-books. Design/methodology/approach ‐ Experimental method of research was used to carry out the study. Experiment was conducted on fourth-grade students in an international school in Kuwait. The control group consisted of nine students. The experimental group had 16 students: eight read the book under the "read-to-me" feature and the other half read the book alone. Students in the two groups were assigned readings randomly and their reactions were studied and compared using different methods. Findings ‐ The experiment demonstrated that students enjoyed reading the electronic medium more than the paperback alternative. The difference, however, was not significant. In addition, difference between the comprehension levels of the three conditions was also insignificant. Students did, however, finish reading the paperback book in a significantly shorter time. Research limitations/implications ‐ A pilot study would have been desirable and also the number of questions asked in the comprehension test could have been expanded. The authors were also not able to explore the possibility of using an automated tool to record the reading time. The two reading instruments used (iPads and iPods) might have affected the students' understanding and enjoyment of the book, although no noticeable differences were found. Practical implications ‐ The experiment indicted that one of the apparent benefits of reading the e-book was its built-in picture dictionary, as the book used in the study incorporated a lot of word coinage in his texts. Lessons learnt from the study can benefit in enhancing features of e-books and designing reading programmes to help build more positive attitude towards reading among children. Originality/value ‐ Little research has been reported in the literature on investigation of e-books towards reading attitude particularly using empirical studies or experimental research. Most literature focuses on availability of e-books and their features. This study makes a good contribution to the literature on this important aspect of research and makes available useful practical information as well.	Children, electronic books	2014-07-01 00:00:00

In this context, KM curriculum design becomes a major challenge for educators. This study was designed with the purpose of analyzing the perceptions of senior KM academics and KM experts about the relevance and value of KM constructs in graduate programs. KM curriculum content was proposed based on an earlier study of KM modules (Rehman and Sumait, 2010). KM modules: An analysis of course. In Paper presented at the Pre-conference on LIS Education in Developing Countries, 75th Annual IFLA Conference, Milan, Italy; revised version accepted for publication in Journal of Information and Knowledge Management, 2010) about what is being taught in the KM programs. We also used findings of a validated set of KM taxonomy that indicated both the structure of the discipline and disciplinary content expressed in standard terminology (Tan, 2010; Chaudhry and Lee, 2009). Intellectual structure of knowledge management. The International Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Change Management, (9)). Two hundred KM academics and experts were identified internationally as potential participants. They were requested to respond to a Web-based survey, indicating their perceptions about the value and relevance of KM statements/modules. Fifty-one of them responded to the survey. The results have indicated that the academics placed a great deal of emphasis on the conceptual foundations of the discipline for its inclusion in the curriculum. KM modules related to KM processes, knowledge sources, KM technology, knowledge organisation, and knowledge sharing received a clear emphasis. It is expected that the findings of this study will be useful for those engaged in curriculum design or revision.	Knowledge management, coursework, curriculum, KM education	2013-06-01 00:00:00

The theoretical response from the bearing system due to an inner race defect coupled with additive noise of varying magnitude form the simulated signal. Methodology of defect detection includes three steps. Firstly, wavelet transformation of noisy vibration signal has been obtained using fbsp wavelets with appropriate parameters. Then, maximum wavelet coefficients were retained from the result of transformation on which a threshold level was applied. Finally fast Fourier transformation was applied on these retained coefficients to identify the presence of components at characteristic frequency corresponding to the defect location. The results show that the method could specifically identify bearing defects even from noisy vibration signals.	Rolling bearing, vibration, defect, frequency B-spline wavelet	2016-12-01 00:00:00

In the present work, an investigation has been made to estimate the load on a rolling element in a bearing subjected to dynamic loading. The dynamic loading, in the present study, included harmonic and periodic loadings which are deterministic functions of time. The roller load is also investigated under random loading with known statistical values of mean and variance. Numerical values have been obtained for NJ204 bearing with known radial clearance. These results show the variation in the spectra obtained for different nature of external loadings.

Existing findings tend to be inconsistent possibly because of the different definitions for speed variations, different crash type consideration or different modelling and data aggregation approaches. This study explores the relationships of speed variations with crashes on a freeway section in the UK. Crashes split by vehicle type (heavy and light vehicles) and by severity mode (killed/serious injury and slight injury crashes) are aggregated based on the similarities of the conditions just before their occurrence (condition-based approach) and modelled using Multivariate Poisson lognormal regression. The models control for speed variations along with other traffic and weather variables as well as their interactions. Speed variations are expressed as two separate variables namely the standard deviations of speed within the same lane and between-lanes over a five-minute interval. The results, similar for all crash types (by coefficient significance and sign), suggest that crash rates increase as the within lane speed variations raise, especially at higher traffic volumes. Higher speeds coupled with greater volume and high between-lanes speed variation also increase crash likelihood. Overall, the results suggest that specific combinations of traffic characteristics increase the likelihood of crash occurrences rather than their individual effects. Identification of these specific crash prone conditions could improve our understanding of crash risk and would support the development of more efficient safety countermeasures.

It is by definition a discipline concerned with optimizing design, implementation, integration, operation, improvement and management of high-level systems. Examples of current trends in IE include higher sustainability of green and more efficient energy, advancement in smart products and the “Internet of Things”, upgrading designs to suit the majority of people and rising world markets, and expanding the availability and accessibility of CAD (computer-aided design) and CAE (computer-aided engineering) software on a “Cloud” basis with maximum flexibility and minimal cost. Furthermore, interest in such sub-specializations of IE such as information technology, intelligent systems, optimization, quality, and supply chain management is expected to boost in the upcoming years. This paper is aimed at shedding further light on such trends and advancements in IE and their role in providing novel and environmentally-friendly Saudi Arabia economic opportunities in accordance with the recent Saudi Arabian Vision 2030’s “Pillar 2: A thriving economy.”	Industrial Engineering; Trends in Industrial Engineering; Saudi Arabian Vision.	2018-05-01 00:00:00

These strategies include warranty–based acquisition, quantity–based acquisition, quality–based acquisition, centrally coordinated logistics operations and third-party logistics (3PL) operations. The proposed research integrates two important aspects of an automobile's closed-loop supply chain strategy. The first aspect is optimal transportation planning for raw material parts, newly manufactured and EOL products in a closed-loop supply chain, using demand, collection rate and capacity of associated facilities in the network as functional parameters. We formulated a mixed integer mathematical model for the closed-loop supply chain network with a multi-echelon inventory, multi-period planning and multi-product scenario, which are used to compute the maximum contribution margin generated through different strategies. The second aspect pertains to using the output of the proposed model in first stage to handle the sequential form of a cooperative game. The proposed two–phase decision model analyzes the realization times and delivery limits of different products as an indicator of swapping different strategies. We analyze three instances to understand and validate the applicability of the model. In these scenarios, sensitivity analysis has been performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model. We present managerial insights, leading to flexibility in decision making. It is observed that the demand, collection rate and capacity of network facilities create highly sensitive trilogy for the contribution margin of proposed network. The outcome of this research firstly confers optimal amounts of mass flows in the closed loop supply chain network from a state of the end product (new products, recycled products and non–recycled used products) to a state of the raw material (ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal and shredder fluff). Secondly, authors culminated a confound dichotomy among all reintegration strategies (conveyance, acquisition and cannibalization) by distinct enumeration and quantification (regarding realization times and delivery limits) of each one to forge a robust planning horizon for original equipment manufacturer.

We studied five inventory and production planning models under the continuous and periodic review systems using a discrete event simulation. Under the above review policies, different demand and return rates, as well as manufacturing and remanufacturing lead times, are considered. The total recoverable and serviceable inventory costs and production order variance are considered as the main performance indicators. From the total inventory cost viewpoint, our findings reveal the trade-off between stochastic demand, stochastic lead times, and review periods. It was found that the periodic review system outperforms the continuous review system for higher values of the review period and return to demand rate ratio. Furthermore, remanufacturing demonstrates an appreciable contribution to low order variance in periodic review systems for high values of return to demand ratio and lead times.

One of the most critical factors influencing the sustainability of an agro-food supply chain is its network design. A particularly challenging aspect in this context is the broad range of influencing indicators associated with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of sustainability that need to be considered. However, many of these indicators could not be fully integrated or measured by single-step optimization problems. This paper presents a critical literature review of operational research methods for the design of sustainable supply chains. A novel two-stage hybrid solution methodology is proposed. In the first stage, a partner selection is performed using a hybrid multi criteria decision making based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation method. The result obtained in the first stage is used in the second stage to develop a multi-objective mathematical model to optimize the design of the supply chain network. This approach allows the simultaneous consideration of all three dimensions of sustainability including carbon footprint, water footprint, number of jobs created and the total cost of the supply chain design. The proposed approach generates a Pareto frontier to aid users in making decisions. Numerical experiments are completed utilizing data from an agro-food company to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution methodology. The analyzes of the numerical results provide important organizational, practical and policy insights on (1) the impact of financial and environmental sustainability on supply chain network design (2) the tradeoff analysis between environmental emission, water footprint, societal implications and associated cost for making informed decision on supply chain investment.

The proposed MOP includes three conflicting objectives: maximization of total profit, minimization of supply disruption and opportunism risks, and minimization of carbon emission considering a number of supply chain constraints. Furthermore, this research analyses the effect of social relationship levels between different tiers of SCN on the profitability, risk, and emission over the time. In this regard, we focus on responding to the following questions. (1) How does the evolving social relationship affect the objectives of the supply chain (SC)? (2) How do the upstream firms’ relationships affect the relationships of downstream firms, and how these relationships influence the objectives of the SC? (3) How does the supply disruption risk interact with the opportunism risk through supply chain relationships, and how these risks affect the objectives of the SC? (4) How do these three conflicting objectives trade-off? A Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm–non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) has been employed to solve the presented problem. In order to improve the quality of solutions, tuning parameters of the NSGA-II are modulated using Taguchi approach. An illustrative example is presented to manifest the capability of the model and the algorithm. The results obtained evince the robust performance of the proposed MOP.

In real life, these supply chains face stochastic and non-stationary demand but most of the studies on inventory lot-sizing problem with emission concerns consider deterministic demand. In this paper, we study the inventory lot-sizing problem under non-stationary stochastic demand condition with emission and cycle service level constraints considering carbon cap-and-trade regulatory mechanism. Using a mixed integer linear programming model, this paper aims to investigate the effects of emission parameters, product- and system-related features on the supply chain performance through extensive computational experiments to cover general type business settings and not a specific scenario. Results show that cycle service level and demand coefficient of variation have significant impacts on total cost and emission irrespective of level of demand variability while the impact of product's demand pattern is significant only at lower level of demand variability. Finally, results also show that increasing value of carbon price reduces total cost, total emission and total inventory and the scope of emission reduction by increasing carbon price is greater at higher levels of cycle service level and demand coefficient of variation. The analysis of results helps supply chain managers to take right decision in different demand and service level situations.

The first challenge is the demand׳s elasticity to emissions and price. To entice its emission conscious customers and generate higher demand, the firm incrementally invests in cleaner production technologies. It also adopts a voluntary limit on its emissions from transportation. However, such investments and penalty lead to the second challenge of reduced net profit. To address above trade-off, a Non-Linear Programming (NLP) model with a maximization quadratic profit function has been formulated. Recently developed, Chemical Reaction Optimization algorithm, with superior computational performance, has been adopted to solve the NLP. The output of the model provides near optimal monopolistic price, best attainable reduction in manufacturing emissions through proportional investment and makes a choice of suitable mode of transportation for each type of product offered by the firm. Three types of sensitivity analyses were performed by varying contextual parameters: customers׳ emission elasticity, penalty charged per unit emission and investment coefficient. The results, underpin the importance of investments in cleaner technologies and the need of financial aids for profit maximizing firms operating in cleaner markets.

The uncharacteristic behaviour associated with the problem enhances the computational efforts required to obtain a feasible and near-optimal solution. This paper proposes an algorithm portfolio methodology based on evolutionary algorithms, which takes into account the stochastic nature of customer demand to solve this computationally complex problem. These problems are well known to have computationally complex objective functions, which make their solutions hard to find, particularly when problem instances of large dimensions are considered. Of particular importance in such situations is the timeliness of the solution. For example, Apple was forced to delay their shipments of iPads internationally due to unprecedented demand and issues with their delivery systems in Samsung Electronics and Seiko Epson. Such examples illustrate the importance of stochastic customer demands and the timing of delivery. Moreover, most of the evolutionary algorithms, known for providing computationally efficient solutions, are unable to always provide optimal or near optimal solutions to all the VRPSD instances within allocated time interval. This is due to the characteristic variations in the computational time taken by evolutionary algorithms for same or varying size of the VRPSD instances. Therefore, this paper presents portfolios of different evolutionary algorithms to reduce the computational time taken to resolve the VRPSD. Moreover, an innovative concept of the mobility allowance (MA) in landmoves based on the levy’s distribution function has been introduced to cope with real situations existing in vehicle routing problems. The proposed portfolio approach has been evaluated for the varying instances of the VRPSD. Four of the existing metaheuristics including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Artificial Immune System (AIS), TABU Search (TS) along with new neighbourhood search, are incorporated in the portfolios. Experiments have been performed on varying dimensions of the VRPSD instances to validate the different properties of the algorithm portfolio. An illustrative example is presented to show that the set of metaheuristics allocated to certain number of processors (i.e. algorithm portfolio) performed better than their individual metaheuristics.

customers require more complete and flexible solutions and continue to drastically reduce the number of suppliers. SMEs are trying to address these challenges through cooperation within collaborative enterprise networks (CENs). Human aspects constitute a fundamental issue in these networks as people, as opposed to organizations or Information Technology (IT) systems, cooperate. Since there is a lack of empirical studies on the role of human factors in ITsupported collaborative enterprise networks, this paper addresses the major human aspects encountered in this type of organization. These human aspects include trust issues, knowledge and know-how sharing, coordination and planning activities, and communication and mutual understanding, as well as their influence on the business processes of CENs supported by IT tools. This paper empirically proves that these aspects constitute key factors for the success or the failure of CENs. Two case studies performed on two different CENs in Switzerland are presented and the roles of human factors are identified with respect to the IT support systems. Results show that specific human factors, namely trust and communication and mutual understanding have to be well addressed in order to design and develop adequate software solutions for CENs	Collaborative enterprise networks, human aspects, trust issues, communication, ICT support 	2011-01-01 00:00:00

Young	Learning Collaboration Moderator Services: Supporting Knowledge Based Collaboration	Working Conference on Virtual Enterprises	Wolfson School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, Leicestershire, LE11 3TU, United Kingdom	a.choudhary@sheffield.ac.uk	Collaboration Moderator Services (CMS) as an evolution of earlier Moderator research has emerged to address the issues relating to knowledge based collaboration by providing a set of functionalities such as raising awareness of business opportunities, problems areas, conflicts, change in the item of interests and lessons learned from collaboration. This paper presents a framework for learning CMS within the context of SYNERGY project. It has been shown that knowledge miners of CMS can be used to learn from the databases of the collaborative networked organizations (CNO) and semi-automatically update the CMS Knowledge Base. A case study from construction project has been used to show that the knowledge miner of CMS can “learn” by extracting various kinds of knowledge from Post Project Reports (PPRs) using different text mining techniques. The discovered knowledge in the form of rules relates to improving the processes, identifying recurring problems, good and bad practices, improving customer relationships and enhancing the coordination between members of CNO.

This paper reviews the literature dealing with knowledge discovery and data mining applications in the broad domain of manufacturing with a special emphasis on the type of functions to be performed on the data. The major data mining functions to be performed include characterization and description, association, classification, prediction, clustering and evolution analysis. The papers reviewed have therefore been categorized in these five categories. It has been shown that there is a rapid growth in the application of data mining in the context of manufacturing processes and enterprises in the last 3 years. This review reveals the progressive applications and existing gaps identified in the context of data mining in manufacturing. A novel text mining approach has also been used on the abstracts and keywords of 150 papers to identify the research gaps and find the linkages between knowledge area, knowledge type and the applied data mining tools and techniques.

This includes features of a distributed control paradigm, to adjust to dynamic situations such as frequent process disturbances. Feasibility of a manufacturing enterprise can be enhanced by forming an efficient, flexible, and responsive network of autonomous agents, which can be termed an ‘agent networks’. The flexibility and responsiveness of an agent network can be implemented only when there is proper interaction and communication facility between its various entities. The goal of this paper is to streamline the structural intricacies related to the agent network so that the system as a whole can be more flexible and responsive. In this context, a fuzzy c-means-based clustering algorithm is proposed to group the agents in order to capture effectively the uncertainty and imprecision associated with them. This leads to clustering of the pertinent agents and thus reduces the number of discrete entities of the manufacturing system, thereby simplifying the function of the system. A test problem has been solved to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	manufacturing enterprises, autonomous agents, fuzzy c-means clustering, automated manufacturing system	2007-10-01 00:00:00

One of the major issues in multidiscipline collaborative projects is how best to share and simultaneously exploit different types of expertise, without duplicating efforts or inadvertently causing conflicts or loss of efficiency through misunderstandings of individual or shared goals. Hence the challenges are enormous when considered in the context of distributed decision making from concept design, through product and manufacturing system design, volume production and on into obsolescence. Moderator technology, in the form of knowledge based software support systems, have been successfully demonstrated in both the product and manufacturing system design domains. However, knowledge acquisition, learning and updating of knowledge is yet to be fully studied. This paper presents a knowledge discovery framework to support knowledge acquisition for moderator technology in collaborative projects.

The existence of an infinite {–[PO4(FeF4)2]–}∞ tetrahedral network in an inter-penetrated diamond lattice, along with the presence of seven unique Li sites, presents interesting structural features of this structure-type for energy storage applications. The initial results of (de)lithiation reveal that a relatively low fraction of theoretical capacity may be utilized reversibly (0.2 Li+ ion per formula unit), possibly due to the lack of available free volume for Li+ insertion. The high Li content and the existence of large channels in all 3-dimensions of space also offer opportunities to study this material as a candidate for solid-state electrolytes. The results from electro-impedance measurements reveal the reasonable activation energy of Li diffusion (0.70 eV), which is also supported by theoretical calculations.

The structures consist of anionic layers of vertex-sharing FeO6 octahedra and SO4 tetrahedral units with interlayer space occupied by Na and ammonium ions, respectively. The corner-sharing FeO6 octahedral units form six and three rings similar to hexagonal tungsten bronze sheets also known as kagomé lattice. These sodium and ammonium Jarosites are thermally stable up to 400 °C and undergo facile electrochemical lithium insertion through the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. Galvanostatic charge–discharge indicates that up to 2.25 and 2 lithium ions per formula unit can be inserted at an average voltage of 2.49 and 2.26 V to the sodium and the ammonium Jarosites, respectively, under slow discharge rate of C/50. The cycle-life and experimental achievable capacity show strong dependence on particle sizes and synthesis conditions. A small amount of fluoride substitution improves both achievable capacity and average voltage.

Structures of the crystalline products have been solved through synchrotron powder XRD and single-crystal XRD techniques. This class of materials exhibits the rare coordination of PO43– and NO3– to a single transition metal center and is structurally related to the rare mineral bonshtedtite (Na3FePO4CO3), which has been used as the initial model for predicting phosphatonitrates. (NH4)1–xLixFePO4NO3 has been found to be capable of reversible electrochemical Li- and Na-ion intercalation in the potential range 2.0–4.2 V at a theoretical capacity of ca. 116 mAh·g–1.

The strategic use of strongly coordinating base/solvent as blocking ligand to restrict the structure in 2-D space is explored, and the role of organic base on the overall structure formation is further elaborated. The isostructural [Zn(BDC)(Py)]n (1) and [Co(BDC(Py)]n (2) were formed by the use of strong base pyridine (Py) as a blocking ligand whereas reaction using N-methylimidazole (Mim) in place of pyridine gives [Co(BDC)(Mim)]n (3) with similar topology and coordination environment. The use of weak/non-coordinating base such as 2-chloropyrimidine, pyrazine, and tetramethylammoniumhexafluorophosphate [(CH3)4 N(PF6)] gives the DMF-coordinated 2-D frameworks, [Cu(BDC)(DMF)]n (4), [Zn(BDC)(DMF)]n (5), and [Zn(AmBDC)(DMF)]n (6). All the structures crystallize in monoclinic crystal system yielding 2-D nets with square grid 44 topology and solid state 3-D structure via extensive non-covalent supramolecular interactions. Surface area analysis via N2 adsorption of three representative 2-D coordination polymers, 1, 4, and 6, indicate that 4 has a surface area of 450 m2 g−1 which is a signature of microporosity, while 1 and 6 have moderate (161.6 m2 g−1) and negligible (33 m2 g−1) surface areas, respectively.	2-D coordination polymer, paddle-wheel, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, transition metal, square grid topology	2016-05-01 00:00:00

We report here, for the first time, synthesis of the illusive Li-containing iron borophosphate of a well-known structure type by employing a hydrothermal synthesis route. The compound has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic measurement, and Mössbauer spectroscopy, which unequivocally prove the mixed valency of Fe2+/3+. The compound exhibits a sloppy voltage profile reminiscent of single-phase solid-solution-type behavior on electrochemical lithium and sodium insertion in the voltage range of 2.1–4.0 V and 1.6–4.0 V, respectively. The pure single-phase oxidized end-member Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O was synthesized by chemical delithiation of the as-synthesized compound, and the structure was solved by ab initio methods, followed by Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction data, showing a volume change of 3% with retention of the parent lattice. The oxidized phase was also characterized with magnetic and Mössbauer spectroscopy, which, besides proving the 3+ oxidation state of Fe, showed long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. The electrochemical performance of Li0.8Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O was studied with galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The compound showed facile Li- and Na- (de)-insertion with an average voltage of 3.06 and 2.76 V for Li- and Na-ion cells, respectively, with almost 80% of the theoretical capacity achieved, and a reasonable capacity retention was observed. The results of EIS in the fabricated cells indicated higher impedances for the Na-ion cell, compared to the Li-ion cell. Variable-temperature EIS studies on pressed pellets of Li0.8Fe(H2O)2[BP2O8]·H2O showed high Li-ion conductivity (3.0 × 10–8 S cm–1 at room temperature) with low activation energy (0.20 eV/Li+).

We demonstrate the role of the zero-dimensional four-membered ring monomer and of the one-dimensional ladder structure as the starting building units or synthons involved in the formation of the complex architectures. Thus, we show how the one-dimensional ladder structure transforms to two- and three-dimensional structures under mild conditions. The two-dimensional layer structures also transform to three-dimensional structures, while the zero-dimensional monomer transforms to layered and three-dimensional structures under ordinary reaction conditions. These transformations provide an insight into the possible pathways involved in the building up of the complex structures of metal phosphates. The isolation of amine phosphates during the hydrothermal synthesis of metal phosphates and also the facile reactions between amine phosphates and metal ions to yield a variety of open-framework materials have thrown light on the mechanism of formation and design of these structures. The existence of a hierarchy of open-framework metal oxalates and their ready formation by employing amine oxalates as intermediates provides additional support to the observations made earlier with regard to the phosphates	synthons; phosphates; oxalates; open-framework structures; dimensionalities	2001-03-01 00:00:00

A. S. Nagar, Manauli PO, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India	angshurc@iisermohali.ac.in	Strong hydrogen bonds play a significant role in crystal packing. In particular, the involvement of interactions involving fluorine in controlling the crystal packing requires appropriate attention, especially in the presence of other strong hydrogen bonds. In the present study, a detailed quantitative assessment has been performed of the nature, energetics and topological properties derived from the electron density in model compounds based on fluorinated benzamides (a total of 46 fluorine-substituted benzamides containing multiple fluorine atoms) in the solid state. The primary motivation in the design of such molecules is to enhance the acidity of the interacting H atoms in the presence of an increasing number of F atoms on the molecular scaffold, resulting in increased propensity towards the formation of intermolecular interactions involving organic fluorine. This exercise has resulted in the identification of new and frequently occurring supramolecular synthons involving F atoms in the packing of molecules in the solid state. The energetics associated with short and directional intermolecular Csp2—HF—Csp2 interactions with significantly high electrostatic contributions is noteworthy, and the topological analysis reveals the bonding character of these ubiquitous interactions in crystal packing in addition to the presence of Csp2—FF—Csp2 contacts.	intermolecular interactions; supramolecular synthons; organic fluorine; quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)	2017-10-01 00:00:00

Nagar, Manauli PO, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India	angshurc@iisermohali.ac.in	The C–F group, which is found in a large number of small organic molecules and drugs available in the market, has still not been fully understood in terms of the strength and directionality of the interactions offered by this group in guiding the formation of crystal lattices. In this manuscript, we have tried to understand the role played by the C–F group, using a model system of N-benzylideneanilines, on which we have previously done a systematic study with fluorine as a substituent on both rings. The effect on the packing of these molecules by replacing one of the fluorine atoms by either Cl or Br has been comprehended in this manuscript. It was observed that the features of the difluorinated analogues remained intact when the noninteracting fluorine atom was replaced by Cl or Br, while with the replacement of the interacting fluorine by Cl or Br, completely different packing characteristics were found to be developed. To quantify the strength of the interactions offered by “organic fluorine”, stabilization energies of the dimers (which has been found to interact through the C–H···F hydrogen bond) have been calculated by Gaussian 09 at the MP2 level using a 6-31+G* basis set. These values were found to be between −0.3 and −6.0 kcal/mol. To study the topological properties of the interacting molecular pair, AIM calculations have also been done using AIM2000. In the studied dimers, the existence of bond critical points (BCPs) at the C–H···F hydrogen bond have always been seen and Laplacian at those BCPs has also been found to be positive, which is clearly an indication of a closed shell type of interaction between the C–H and F–C groups.

A. S. Nagar, Manauli PO, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India	angshurc@iisermohali.ac.in	The crystal structures of anhydrous enrofloxacin (EFC) (1), enrofloxacin hexahydrate (EFC·6H2O) (2), enrofloxacin maleate (EFC-M) (3), enrofloxacin hemifumarate (EFC-F) (4), enrofloxacin hemisuccinate (EFC-S) (5), enrofloxacin hemioxalate (EFC-O) (6), enrofloxacin acetate (EFC-A) (7) and ammonium salt of enrofloxacin (Am-EFC) (8) have been determined by using single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The crystals of 1 were grown from a dilute solution of EFC in dilute ammonium hydroxide. The crystals of 2 were grown from a solution of EFC with nicotinic acid. Solvent drop grinding experiments on enrofloxacin with various dicarboxylic acids resulted in four new salts (3–6). When a solution of EFC in glacial acetic acid evaporated to dryness over a period of time, crystals of 7 were grown. Crystals of 8 were found to grow when EFC was dissolved in liquid ammonia and solution was slowly evaporated at room temperature (RT). All these products (1–8) were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Single crystal X-ray diffraction study has indicated that the products 3–6 had a cation of enrofloxacin and an anion of the acid in common. Four of these eight products have been found to contain water of crystallization. Three of these salts were found to have one neutral acid molecule. The proton transfer and hydrate stoichiometry were confirmed from single crystal X-ray diffraction. Solubility of 1 and 3–6 was determined in water (pH = 6.8) using UV–vis spectroscopy at RT. The alteration between the neutral, zwitterionic, anionic and cationic forms EFC has led to very interesting structures of these salt/cocrystals and also the pure forms (1 and 2).

A. S. Nagar, Manauli PO, Mohali, Punjab 140306, India	angshurc@iisermohali.ac.in	The azobenzenes, known for their various importance in the industry, have been chosen as model compounds to understand the role of weak interactions involving the C–X (X = F, Cl, and Br) bond using single-crystal X-ray diffraction technique, especially in the absence of other stronger intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds. The fluorinated compounds have been found to pack in the lattice by utilizing C–H···F hydrogen bonds, whereas the chlorinated and brominated analogues have been found to prefer C–X···X–C, C–X···π, and π···π interactions while packing in the lattice. The stabilization energy offered by the C–H···F hydrogen bonds and the C–X···X–C interactions have been estimated by computational methods using Gaussian 09, and the topological properties have been determined by using the AIM2000 package. The lattice energy decomposition has been done using semiclassical density sums (SCDS) PIXEL method. Our studies indicate that the stabilization energy offered by each C–H···F hydrogen bond lies in the range from −0.8 to −1.0 kcal/mol, while that for the C–X···X–C interaction has been found to be −0.35 kcal/mol for the X = Cl interaction and −0.73 kcal/mol for the X = Br interaction. Further, the analysis of these interaction by atoms in molecules (AIM) theory indicates that the electron densities (ρc) at the bond critical points (BCP) for C–H···F and C–X···X–C (X = Cl and Br), calculated using the AIM2000 package, are small (<0.007 eÅ–3), and the values of Laplacian (∇2ρc) are positive. This indicates that these interactions are of the hydrogen bond type. A detailed study of these interactions by experimental and computational methods has been described in the manuscript.

These complexes were characterized by elemental analyses and NMR (1H, 13C and 31P) spectral studies. A single-crystal X-ray diffraction study confirmed a distorted octahedral geometry for 3. Complexes 2–4 were found to exhibit blue-shifted emission as compared to [Ir(ppy)2(acac)] (acacH = acetylacetone) and [Ir(ppy)2pic] (pic = 2-picolinic acid) because of the presence of strongly π-accepting, Ph2P^PPh2 units. The solution quantum efficiency for 2–4 was measured and 2 showed the highest quantum efficiency. Ground state geometry optimizations for 2–4 were performed using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid functional and excitation energies for low lying singlet and triplet excited states were obtained via time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations.

A. S. Nagar, Manauli PO, Punjab, India	angshurc@iisermohali.ac.in	Fluconazole is known as an antifungal drug since 1983. Its propensity for the formation of new polymorphs and salts has been reported in the literature, mostly by powder X-ray diffraction and solid state Raman spectroscopy. In the present study, we are elucidating the structures of four polymorphs of fluconazole using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Raman spectra of the single crystals of these polymorphs also support our study. These polymorphs were grown in the presence of the cocrystal formers. This indicates that fluconazole interacts with the cocrystal former in the solution, and possibly these interactions result into the generation of new polymorphs of it. These polymorphs of fluconazole exhibit the conformational flexibility of the molecule, and hence we observed seven different conformers of the molecule in the reported polymorphs. Although these forms have strong O–H···N hydrogen bonds, the nature of the packing of the molecules is a cumulative effect of a number of weaker intermolecular forces such as C–H···O, C–H···N, and C–H···F and the strong hydrogen bond.

The tapeworm was found in two cichlid species, Aequidens coeruleopunctatus and Cryptoheros panamensis in two tributaries of the Chagres River / Panama Canal drainage, Soberania National Park area, Panama. Sequence data from the ITS-1 region of the rRNA genome corroborate the identifications based on diagnostic morphological features. The tapeworm was not found in 201 of the other 15 species of fish belonging to 6 families that were collected during the same time. Using historical records, we argue that the tapeworm was likely introduced with the stocking of one of its principal hosts, grass carp, during early attempts to control aquatic vegetation in the Canal zone, and we predict that it is probably more widely distributed in the area, especially in Gatun Lake. The impact of this tapeworm on the native fish resources of Panama remains unknown, but is noteworthy for its presence in an already ecologically impacted region of the Neotropics.

In total, 84 specimens of 4 species of ictalurids (Ictalurus balsanus, Ictalurus dugesi, Ictalurus furcatus, and Ictalurus punctatus) were sampled from 7 localities in 5 hydrological drainages. Ten species of adult endohelminths were recovered from this survey, including 4 species of digeneans (Phyllodistomum lacustri, Genarchella tropica, Alloglossidium corti, and Campechetrema sp.), 3 cestodes (Corallobothrium fimbriatum, Megathylacoides giganteum, and Choanoscolex lamothei), and 3 nematodes (Dichelyne mexicanus, Goezia sp., and Rhabdochona sp.). The adult helminth fauna of ictalurids reported in this study is composed of taxa that are typical of ictalurids in other parts of North America, north of Mexico. This core fauna (in a historical biogeographic sense) includes the corallobothriines C. fimbriatum and M. giganteum and the digeneans P. lacustri and A. corti. Two other helminths, C. lamothei and D. mexicanus, may be added to this group in the future. Other helminths occurred sporadically and provide evidence for host-sharing (ecological host extensions), but we were unable to identify any valid cases of host-switching from more distantly related hosts. The helminth fauna provides evidence that the ictalurids developed their characteristic helminth fauna without neotropical influences and that the phylogenetic affinities of the ictalurids do not appear to be with any neotropical siluriform.

Here we combined quantitative proteomics with CBP/p300-specific catalytic inhibitors, bromodomain inhibitor, and gene knockout to reveal a comprehensive map of regulated acetylation sites and their dynamic turnover rates. CBP/p300 acetylates thousands of sites, including signature histone sites, as well as a multitude of sites on signaling effectors and enhancer-associated transcriptional regulators. Time-resolved acetylome analyses identified a subset of CBP/p300-regulated sites with very rapid (<30 min) acetylation turnover, revealing a dynamic balance between acetylation and deacetylation. Quantification of acetylation, mRNA, and protein abundance after CBP/p300 inhibition reveals a kinetically competent network of gene expression that strictly depends on CBP/p300-catalyzed rapid acetylation. Collectively, our in-depth acetylome analyses reveal systems attributes of CBP/p300 targets, and the resource dataset provides a framework for investigating CBP/p300 functions, as well as for understanding the impact of small molecule inhibitors targeting its catalytic and bromodomain activities.	acetylation, CBP, p300, proteomics, mass spectrometry, A-485, bromodomain, acetylation kinetics, enhancer, gene transcription	2018-05-01 00:00:00

By combining proximity labeling with quantitative mass spectrometry, we generated high-resolution interaction neighborhood maps of the endogenously expressed DNA repair factors 53BP1, BRCA1, and MDC1. Our spatially resolved interaction maps reveal rich network intricacies, identify shared and bait-specific interaction modules, and implicate previously concealed regulators in this process. We identified a novel vertebrate-specific protein complex, shieldin, comprising REV7 plus three previously uncharacterized proteins, RINN1 (CTC-534A2.2), RINN2 (FAM35A), and RINN3 (C20ORF196). Recruitment of shieldin to DSBs, via the ATM-RNF8-RNF168-53BP1-RIF1 axis, promotes NHEJ-dependent repair of intrachromosomal breaks, immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR), and fusion of unprotected telomeres. Shieldin functions as a downstream effector of 53BP1-RIF1 in restraining DNA end resection and in sensitizing BRCA1-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors. These findings have implications for understanding cancer-associated PARPi resistance and the evolution of antibody CSR in higher vertebrates.	proteomics, DNA damage repair, NHEJ, proximity labeling, shieldin, telomere maintenance, antibody class-switch recombination, 53BP1, BRCA1, PARP inhibitors	2018-04-01 00:00:00

However, the stoichiometry of acetylation has not been studied and is important for understanding whether SIRT3 regulates or suppresses acetylation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured acetylation stoichiometry in mouse liver tissue and found that SIRT3 suppressed acetylation to a very low stoichiometry at its target sites. By examining acetylation changes in the liver, heart, brain, and brown adipose tissue of fasted mice, we found that SIRT3‐targeted sites were mostly unaffected by fasting, a dietary manipulation that is thought to regulate metabolism through SIRT3‐dependent deacetylation. Globally increased mitochondrial acetylation in fasted liver tissue, higher stoichiometry at mitochondrial acetylation sites, and greater sensitivity of SIRT3‐targeted sites to chemical acetylation in vitro and fasting‐induced acetylation in vivo, suggest a nonenzymatic mechanism of acetylation. Our data indicate that most mitochondrial acetylation occurs as a low‐level nonenzymatic protein lesion and that SIRT3 functions as a protein repair factor that removes acetylation lesions from lysine residues.	acetylation; mass spectrometry; proteomics; SIRT3; stoichiometry	2015-09-01 00:00:00

A. A. Shoukat Choudhury	Novel Data Segmentation Methods for Data Driven Process Analyses	Computer Aided Chemical Engineering	Department of Chemical Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh	shoukat@che.buet.ac.bd	With the advent of computer control and Distributed Control System (DCS), it has become easy for process industries to store a huge amount of data everyday. These data are rich sources of information. Often it requires selecting a window of data from a large data set for calculating or estimating various performance metrics of the control loops or the process itself. For example, if data is collected at a sampling rate of 4 s, there will be 21,600 samples for each variable each day. Calculation of a performance measure or metric requires only a few hundred or a couple of thousand data points. The question is which part of the data should be used. This study attempts to find suitable data segmentation methods appropriate for the various purposes of data analysis. This study utilizes various simple statistical measures such as autocovariance function, signal to noise ratio, and skewness for selecting appropriate segment of the data. The performance of the segmentation methods has been evaluated using simulation examples and real industrial data sets. The selection of appropriate window of data largely increases the reliability of the data driven analyses.

Nonlinearities can initiate oscillations in process variables that may cause plantwide oscillations, which in turn results in loss of plant profitability and rapid wear and tear of plant machinery. Thus, quantification of nonlinearity is important for designing appropriate controllers, troubleshooting process faults and ensuring smooth operation of a process plant. In this paper, two data-based nonlinearity measures namely, bicoherence and surrogate-data based measures are compared using physical models of a few common processes to identify which method works better for which process.	nonlinearity, bicoherence, surrogate, modeling	2015-06-01 00:00:00

Cascade control is extensively applied in process industry as an effective strategy to restrain disturbances and compensate process nonlinearities. In recent years many studies have been performed on the detection and quantification of valve stiction in single feedback control loops. However, there is a lack in developing a mechanism which can analyze stiction induced oscillation in cascade control loops. This work focuses on the frequency analysis of stiction induced oscillations in cascade control loops and proposes a mechanism of oscillation compensation through outer and inner controller tuning. The effect of oscillation compensation by changing control strategies is also discussed. The theoretical analysis is evaluated through simulation examples and a pilot-scale flow-level cascade control experiment.

The approach is based on a modified structure of the Smith predictor that allows the user to isolate the disturbance and set-point responses and thereby, provide a two-degrees-of-freedom control scheme. The proposed structure is easy to analyze and tune. Using an estimation of the dead time and process model of the plant, the proposed compensator is left with two tuning parameters that determine the closed-loop performance and robustness. The performance of the proposed compensator is compared with the most recent dead time compensator appeared in the literature. The method is evaluated on two simulated processes and a computer-interfaced pilot-scale two tank heating system to demonstrate the practicality and utility of the proposed scheme.

Shoukat Choudhury	Detection of control loop interactions and prioritization of control loop maintenance	Control Engineering Practice	Department of Chemical Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh	shoukat@che.buet.ac.bd	Chemical processes with multiloop control configurations have significant amount of control loop interactions due to tight mass and heat integration. Change in set point and/or controller parameters of one control loop may affect the variables of other loops. The presence of loop interactions in a process plant can cause significant quality and production losses of the plant. It is challenging to measure the degree of interaction between control loops and rank the loops according to the extent of interactions. This paper presents two data driven techniques to quantify control loop interactions and rank the loops according to their importance. In the first approach, a novel method based on canonical correlation analysis has been developed to calculate interaction among the loops and then normalization is done with respect to the maximum canonical correlation to determine the rank of the loops. In another approach, two indices have been developed using integral of absolute or squared error criteria to quantify loop interaction and determine rank of the loops. Both methods require step test data of the plant. Simulation and experimental results show the validity and efficacy of the proposed methods.

Therefore, the users could avail the offered services after getting authenticated of any service provider using the same registration credentials. In recent years, many multi-server authentication protocols have been demonstrated. Nonetheless, the existing schemes do not meet the security and efficiency requirements of the time. Recently, Chuang et al. presented a multi-server biometric authentication protocol which was later crypt-analysed and improved by Lin et al. with the identification of few attacks. Later, we discover that Lin et al.’s protocol is still prone to replay attack, privileged insider attack, trace attack, de-synchronization attack and key-compromise impersonation attacks. In this study, we present a multi-server authentication protocol which is not only comparable with Lin et al.’s scheme but also efficient than other state-of-the-art multi-server protocols.

In this paper, we have emphasized only on the MSA-based schemes that do not require online registration authority for mutual authentication.

In view of those shortcomings, we present an anonymous MSA protocol that nearly counters all those problems using elliptic curve cryptography and escaping costly pairing operations.

Recently, Lu et al.’s scheme demonstrated that Mishra et al.’s scheme is unguarded to perfect forward secrecy compromise, server masquerading, and forgery attacks, and presented a better scheme. However, we discovered that Lu et al.’s scheme is still susceptible to malicious insider attack and non-compliant to perfect forward secrecy.

Those advances encompass the ever increasing innovative digital and remote mobile devices being operated on the users’ end. Due to the openness of critical system, the service providers in such networks are facing security challenges to authenticate those mobile devices on the field, and delivering services. In this scenario, the Multi-server authentication (MSA) framework seems to be a promising solution that enables its subscribers to avail services from different servers without getting registered to each server individually. In last few years many MSA protocols depending on RC-Offline authentication during mutual authentication, have been presented. However, to date, there is no efficient MSA scheme to our knowledge that is free of all three weaknesses, simultaneously. That is, 1) free from storage of server-based parameters (public keys or other values) in smart card by registration authority, 2) free from the assumption of publishing of server-based public keys publicly and 3) free from a single secret sharing with all servers so that it could avoid server masquerading (insider) attack. Considering these limitations, we present a multi-server authentication protocol that withstands above drawbacks using lightweight cryptographic operations. The rationale of the proposed work was to present an efficient RC-Offline MSA scheme. Our scheme is also backed by formal security analysis based on GNY logic and automated security verification using ProVerif tool.

We have utilized the random oracle model in order to perform security analysis. The analysis endorses that the proposed scheme is robust enough to provide protection against all potential attacks specially smart card stolen attack and user anonymity violation attack. Analysis is further substantiated through an automated software application ProVerif. The analysis also shows that proposed scheme is computationally efficient than Mir and Nikooghadam’s scheme.

Manifold increase in the number of mobile devices and subscribers in MCC has further enhanced the need of an efficient and robust authentication solution. Earlier, the subscribers could get cloud-computing services from the cloud service providers only after having consulted the trusted third party. Recently, Tsai and Lo has proposed a multi-server authenticated key agreement solution for MCC based on bilinear pairing, to eliminate the trusted third party for mutual authentication. The scheme has been novel as far as the minimization of trusted party involvement in authenticating the user and service provider, is concerned. However, the Tsai and Lo scheme has been found vulnerable to server spoofing attack (misrepresentation attack), de-synchronization attack and denial-of-service attack, which renders the scheme unsuitable for practical deployment in different wireless mobile access networks. Therefore, we have proposed an improved model based on bilinear pairing, countering the identified threats posed to Tsai and Lo scheme. Besides, the proposed work also demonstrates performance evaluation and formal security analysis.

Previously, a subscriber had to register from each service provider individually to avail respective services relying on single server authentication. In the past, a number of multi-server authentication techniques can be witnessed that employed lightweight and even computationally intensive cryptographic operations. In line with this, Zhu has presented a chaotic map based multi-server authentication scheme recently, which is not only vulnerable to denial-of-service attack, stolen-verifier attack, but also lacks anonymity. This research aims at improving the Zhu’s protocol in terms of cost and efficiency. Moreover, the comparative study is presented for the performance of improved model against the existing scheme, and the security of proposed model is formally proved using BAN Logic.

Many of such schemes are proved to have weaknesses against known attacks. Furthermore, numerous such schemes cannot be used in real time scenarios. Because they assume a single server for authentication across the globe. Very recently, Amin et al. (J. Med. Syst. 39(11):180, 2015) designed an authentication scheme for secure communication between a patient and a medical practitioner using a trusted central medical server. They claimed their scheme to extend all security requirements and emphasized the efficiency of their scheme. However, the analysis in this article proves that the scheme designed by Amin et al. is vulnerable to stolen smart card and stolen verifier attacks. Furthermore, their scheme is having scalability issues along with inefficient password change and password recovery phases. Then we propose an improved scheme. The proposed scheme is more practical, secure and lightweight than Amin et al.’s scheme.

Security and privacy element needs to be there for any physician or caregiver to make certain an appropriate diagnosis, medical treatment or any other exchange of critical information. In this connection, many relevant TMIS-based authentication schemes have been presented, however various forms of attacks and inefficiencies render these schemes inapplicable for a practical scenario. Lately, Amin et al. proposed a scheme based on a multi-server authentication for TMIS. However, the Amin et al., scheme has been found vulnerable to user and server impersonation attacks. We have proposed an improved model with higher performance and efficiency, as evident from the forthcoming sections. Besides, the scheme has been backed up by formal security analysis using BAN logic to ensure the resilience of the proposed scheme.

Besides the numerous benefits of global network expansion, secure communication and authentication among the comprising elements of the global network is also posing great challenges. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a key agreement scheme in order to facilitate user authenticity using elliptic curve cryptography. Huang et al. further emphasized the scheme is secure. Nevertheless, comprehensive analysis in this paper, demonstrates that Huang et al. scheme has correctness issues and is prone to impersonation/forgery attack. Then an improved scheme is presented to tenacity the said glitches existent in Huang et al.’s scheme. The security analysis of proposed scheme is substantiated in random oracle model. Furthermore, a simulation of proposed scheme is carried out by automated formal tool ProVerif. The performance and security assessments show that the scheme presented in this paper withstand impersonation attack and offers adequate security while reducing significant computation cost as compared with Huang et al.’s scheme. Hence, due to better performance and security, the proposed scheme is the appropriate one for security sensitive and resource constrained environments.

Wang and Qin declared that their technique satisfies the security expectations or requirements intended for mobile pay-TV system. However, this work indicates that Wang and Qin’s scheme suffers from a nontrivial weakness. Successful impersonation attack is easily possible from an adversary who can impersonate mobile set (MS) to cheat the head-end system (HS). An adversary does not even need secret information to do so. As a remedy, we proposed an enhanced authentication technique for mobile pay-TV systems by taking a slight change in Wang and Qin’s scheme.

Earlier, through single-server authentication, a user had to register all servers individually for availing the respective services. In the last few years, many MSA-based schemes have been presented; however, most of these suffer communication overhead cost due to the Registration Centre (RC) involvement in every mutual authentication session. In voice communication this round-trip latency becomes even more noticeable. Hence, the focus of the protocols design has been shifted towards light-weight cryptographic techniques such as Chebyshev chaotic map technique (CCM). We have reviewed few latest MSA-related schemes based on CCM and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) as well. Based on these limitations and considerations, we have proposed a single-round trip MSA protocol based on CCM technique that foregoes the RC involvement during mutual authentication. Our study work is cost efficient in terms of communication delay and computation, and provides enhanced security by the use of public key cryptosystem. The proposed scheme is duly backed by formal security analysis and performance evaluation.

IoT enables smooth and efficient utilization of SG. It is assumed as the prevalent illustration of IoT at the moment. IP-based communication technologies are used for setting SG communication network, but they are challenged by huge volume of delay sensitive data and control information between consumers and utility providers. It is also challenged by numerous security attacks due to resource constraints in smart meters. Sundry schemes proposed for addressing these problems are inappropriate due to high communication, computation overhead and latency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Diffie–Hellman based lightweight authentication scheme using AES and RSA for session key generation. To ensure message integrity, the advantages of hash based message authentication code are exploited. The scheme provides mutual authentication, thwarting replay and man-in-the-middle attacks and achieves message integrity, while reducing overall communication and computation overheads.

Very recently Zhang et al. proposed symmetric key based anonymous authentication scheme for SIP. They claimed the scheme to provide privacy and anonymity, but the analysis in this paper expose that Zhang et al.’s scheme does not provide dynamic identity hence it is not anonymous.

All such online services are provided remotely facilitating the users to freely move any where with out disruption of the services. In order to ensure seamless and secure services to the remote user such services espouse authentication protocols. A number of authentication protocols are readily available to achieve security and privacy in remote client server architecture. Most of these schemes are tailored for single server architecture. In such scenario, if a user wants to attain the services provided by more than one servers he has to register with each server. In recent times, multiserver authentication has got much attention, where a user can register once and then can acquire services provided by multiple servers. Very recently, Lu et al. proposed a biometric, smart card and password-based three factor authentication scheme usable for multiserver environments. Furthermore, Lu et al. identified their scheme to resist known attacks. However, the analysis in this paper ascertains that Lu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to impersonation attack. An adversary registered to the system just after knowing the public identity of a user can impersonate himself as the latter. Then we propose an improvement over Lu et al.’s scheme. Our improvement is more robust than the existing schemes. The security of proposed scheme is substantiated formally along with informal security discussion, while same is also validated using a popular automated tool ProVerif. The analysis confirms that proposed scheme achieves mutual authentication and is robust against known attacks. In addition, the proposed scheme does not incur any extra computation as compared with Lu et al.’s scheme.	Biometrics, Authentication, Multiserver, Impersonation attack, Smart

SIP supports HTTP digest based authentication, and is responsible for creating, maintaining and terminating sessions. To guarantee secure SIP based communication, a number of authentication schemes are proposed, typically most of these are based on smart card due to its temper resistance property. Recently Zhang et al. presented an authenticated key agreement scheme for SIP based on elliptic curve cryptography. However Tu et al. (Peer to Peer Netw.

Very recently Farash (Peer to Peer Netw. Appl 1–10, 2014) points out that Tu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to server impersonation attack, Farash also proposed an improvement on Tu et al.’s scheme. However, our analysis in this paper shows that Tu et al.’s scheme is insecure against server impersonation attack. Further both Tu et al.’s scheme and Farash’s improvement do not protect user’s privacy and are vulnerable to replay and denial of services attacks. In order to cope with these limitations, we have proposed a privacy preserving improved authentication scheme based on ECC. The proposed scheme provides mutual authentication as well as resists all known attacks as mentioned by Tu et al. and Farash.

Patient security and privacy has emerged as key issues during remote access because of underlying open architecture. An authentication scheme can verify patient’s as well as TMIS server’s legitimacy during remote healthcare services. To achieve security and privacy a number of authentication schemes have been proposed. Very recently Lu et al. (J. Med.

Further, they emphasized the robustness of their scheme against several attacks. However, in this paper we establish that Lu et al.’s scheme is vulnerable to numerous attacks including (1) Patient anonymity violation attack, (2) Patient impersonation attack, and (3) TMIS server impersonation attack. Furthermore, their scheme does not provide patient untraceability. We then, propose an improvement of Lu et al.’s scheme. We have analyzed the security of improved scheme using popular automated tool ProVerif. The proposed scheme while retaining the plusses of Lu et al.’s scheme is also robust against known attacks.

Wireless systems inherently are insecure and resource (power) constrained, to deal with these constraints, many techniques for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are defined. One such important developement is Signcryption to achieve message confidentiality, integrity, sender and message authentication, non repudiation, forward secrecy as well as unforgeability,and public verifiability. Since Signcryption combines the signature and encryption therefore the cost is very less in comparison to those schemes based on the signature then encryption. Many signcryption schemes have been proposed based on El-Gamal, RSA and ECC till today. This paper highlights limitations of the existing ECC based schemes using signcryption. These limitations include some missing security aspects as well as high computation power requirement, more communication overhead incurred and large memory requirements. Further it proposes an efficient lightweight signcryption scheme based on HECC which fulfills all the security requirements. The scheme reduced significant amounts of computation, communication costs and message size as compared to existing signcryption schemes making it the good candidate for environments suffer from the resource limitation problems.

The SIP protocol is insecure for being an open text-based protocol inherently. Different solutions have been presented in the last decade to secure the protocol. Recently, Zhang et al. authentication protocol has been proposed with a sound feature that authenticates the users without any password-verifier database using smart card. However, the scheme has a few limitations and can be made more secure and optimized regarding cost of exchanged messages, with a few modifications. Our proposed key-agreement protocol makes a use of two server secrets for robustness and is also capable of authenticating the involved parties in a single round-trip of exchanged messages. The server can now authenticate the user on the request message received, rather than the response received upon sending the challenge message, saving another round-trip of exchanged messages and hence escapes a possible denial of service attack.

This study simulated water and heat flows by HYDRUS-1D model under rice-straw mulching and bare soil treatments for rain-fed soybean (Glycine max) cultivation at Gifu Prefecture in central Japan. Soil hydraulic and thermal parameters with the straw mulching were optimized by adding a hypothetical 3-cm straw layer. The optimized parameters were validated with field-measured soil-moisture and temperature regimes of two consecutive soybean-growing seasons of 2015 and 2016. HYDRUS-1D model performed fairly well in simulating heat and water movements at 5, 15 and 25 cm soil depths under the two treatments. The model simulated soil moisture and temperature with small Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.016–0.044 cm3  cm–3 for soil moisture and 0.94–1.63 °C for soil temperature. The simulation results revealed that straw mulching increased soil moisture but reduced soil temperature at the three soil depths compared to the bare soil. The moisture content of the additional straw layer (3 cm) and heat flow through it showed a decreasing pattern compared to the soil layers. The straw mulching contributed 16–96% vapor to the total water flow and stored/released 0.0322 to 0.0295 MJ m–2 heat per day at 0–3 cm straw layer. Water balance in the soybean field revealed that the straw layer enhanced rain water infiltration by limiting evaporation from the soil surface. The simulation results can be useful for better management of soil hydro-thermal regimes under straw-mulched fields in dryland cultivations.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the best management options for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An ecosystem model DayCent was tested for two rice (Oryza sativa L.) experimental sites in Bangladesh. The sites are under different management practices and we first tested the models ability to simulate SOC turnover, and then estimated the potential for SOC sequestration by comparing change in SOC for each management scenario with baseline management (current farmers’ practices) including conventional tillage, 5% residue incorporation and nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Predicted yield was also compared at both sites to ensure that yield was not compromised by mitigation measures. A control treatment was tested at both sites. At site 1, two other treatments of mineral N fertilizer, and combination of farmyard manure (FYM) and N were tested in a double rice based crop rotation. At site 2, a treatment receiving cowdung (CD) application, and a combination of CD and N were tested in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-rice based crop rotation. The DayCent model was able to simulate SOC increase from the double rice test sites under unfertilized conditions, considering additional N and C sources in the simulations. Assuming N fertilizer (180 kg N ha−1 yr−1) application for site 1, and CD application (25 t ha−1 yr−1) for site 2, respectively, as the baseline, four single, and one integrated, scenarios were implemented in the model to predict SOC and yield at both sites. Two additional scenarios with alternate wet and drying (AWD) as a single treatment, and as part of an integrated approach, were also tested for their mitigation potential at site 1. The highest simulated positive impact on SOC development (60% higher than that of the baseline) was observed at site 1 when FYM was used in place of mineral N fertilizer. As there is a yield penalty associated with the use of only FYM, integrated approaches might show more promise, such as inclusion of 15% residue return, reduced tillage, less mineral N fertilizer, FYM addition, with or without AWD. This approach increases SOC by up to 23% while keeping the yield stable (nearly 3.5 t ha−1). The application of CD only as determined for baseline of site 2, gives a yield of about 1.8 t ha−1 yr−1. In contrast nearly two times more yield was obtained under the scenario associated with integrated management which also increases SOC by 30% relative to the baseline at the second site. Net GHG emissions, including nitrous oxide and methane emissions were estimated using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tier 1 methods, and country specific emission factors (where available), suggests that the integrated management scenario can reduce the net GHG emissions from 0.58-0.82 t carbon dioxide (CO2)-eq. ha−1 yr−1 (equivalent to 0.16-0.24 t Ceq. ha−1 yr−1) at site 2, while a net reduction in GHGs of nearly 1.00 t CO2-eq. ha−1 yr−1 (equivalent to 0.27 t Ceq. ha−1 yr−1) at site 1 was only achieved if AWD was also implemented with the integrated management scenario. Future studies could attempt to model non-CO2 GHGs with a dynamic model.	Carbon sequestration,Rice,Agricultural management,Mitigation potential,Bangladesh	2018-07-01 00:00:00

This is expected to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from paddy rice ecosystems, unless mitigation measures are in place. It is therefore important to assess GHG mitigation potential whilst maintaining yield. Using the process-based ecosystem model DayCent, a spatial analysis was carried out in a rice harvested area in Bangladesh for the period 1996 to 2015, considering the impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, GHG emissions and yield under various mitigation options. An integrated management (IM, a best management practice) considering reduced water, tillage with residue management, reduced mineral nitrogen fertilizer and manure, led to a net offset by, on average, −2.43 t carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq.) ha−1 year−1 (GHG removal) and a reduction in yield-scaled emissions intensity by −0.55 to −0.65 t CO2-eq. t−1 yield. Under integrated management, it is possible to increase SOC stocks on average by 1.7% per year in rice paddies in Bangladesh, which is nearly 4 times the rate of change targeted by the “4 per mille” initiative arising from the Paris Climate Agreement.	greenhouse gas (GHG); rice; mitigation potential; DayCent; spatial; Bangladesh	2018-07-01 00:00:00

It is, however, unclear how such conditions then impact net soil N-release and availability to the rice crop, because we do not know well enough how water-saving irrigation management shapes depth-distribution of Eh and reductive processes, and microbial activity. A field experiment with rice was laid out on a typical young floodplain paddy soil of Bangladesh with three irrigation schemes, viz. continuous flooding (CF), safe alternate wetting and drying (AWD) and direct seeded rice (DSR), with 120 kg N ha−1 (N120) or without (N0) urea application. We evaluated changes in soil mineral N and plant N uptake, CH4 and CO2 emissions and soil pH, and at multiple depths soil Eh and temperature, dissolved C, Fe and Mn throughout 2015 dry (Boro) season (Jan–Apr). Eh stayed at or above ∼+300 mV except for sudden drops to ∼−200 mV with irrigation events in DSR. Eh quickly dropped to methanogenic conditions, under both AWD and CF; rises to ∼+200 mV were observed during AWD-drainage events but were restricted to upper 5.5 or 12.5 cm depths. Throughout the growing season there was a pronounced increase in reductive dissolution of Fe and Mn (hydro-) oxides, buildup of dissolved C, and CH4 effluxes under AWD and CF but not DSR, likely at least partially driven by the gradual soil warming from ∼20 °C till 28 °C. Predominant aerobic conditions under DSR lead to a nearly doubled C-emissions (CO2 + CH4) compared to AWD and CF, suggesting more soil organic matter (OM) degradation in the former case, while soil mineral N plus plant N build-up rate followed an opposite order. Urea application did not raise soil exchangeable N levels, even prior to significant plant uptake from 28 DAT (days after transplanting), and we forward temporal abiotic NH4+-fixation and N-removal processes as explanations. We conclude that regardless of some distinctions in temporal evolutions of puddle layer Eh, solution C, Fe and Mn, and CH4-emission, soil N-supply was quite comparable under AWD and CF, as was rice yield. In the context of N availability, AWD could be safely adopted for rice growth in the Bangladeshi Boro season. The eventual fertilizer N recovery efficiency was higher for CF (42%) than for AWD (32%), but AWD saved 12% irrigation water. While DSR saved 45% water there was a large yield penalty, likely due to drought stress but also by poor germination caused by cold night temperatures in mid-January, while seedling transplantation in CF and AWD plots was only later on 28 January. Further research should be conducted to investigate the fast and pronounced removal of exchangeable inorganic N after initial N buildup by soil OM mineralization, especially in CF and AWD. At this moment most likely candidate processes appear clay-NH4+ fixation and anaerobic NH4+-oxidation.

Each crop was grown under six different treatments viz. 100% compost (T0), 75% compost + 25% soil (T1), 50% compost + 50% soil (T2), 25% compost + 75% soil (T3), 100% soil (T4) and farmers practice- (T5) (75% of recommended rate of NPK plus soil). A single factor experiment was laid out in a with three replications. The results revealed that in Chilli, application of 75% compost plus 25% soil (T1) produced significantly the tallest plant (45.50 cm), maximum number of flowers (25.00) and fruits (21.00) plant-1, longest leaf (11.67 cm), longest root (5.43 cm) and greater yield of fruits plant-1 (168.30 g). This treatment also produced the tallest plant (45.33 cm), maximum flowers plant-1 (2.33), longest leaf (11.55 cm) and higher fresh weight of single flower (7.34 g) of Dahlia. Compost treatment also significantly influenced various plant characters of Marigold where 75% compost + 25% soil (T1) gave the tallest plant (16.33 cm), higher weight of fresh flower (10.52 g), longest leaf (10.10 cm) and maximum flowers plant-1 (16.33). Plants grown in 100% compost showed the longest duration in case of Dahlia (19 days) and Marigold (23 days) flowering. From the findings, it can be inferred that use of 75% compost prepared from solid wastes of Mymensingh municipality area plus 25% soil appeared to be the best practice for obtaining the maximum yield of Chilli, Dahlia and Marigold.

To protect the crop from hot summer and to utilize rainfall for its cultivation, selection of appropriate mulching material(s) is crucial. For optimum production of the crop, soil moisture and temperature regimes as well as water use efficiency (WUE) of the crop were investigated under straw, grass, paper, plastic and bare soil (control) mulching under rain-fed condition at Gifu university farm in Japan. The mulching treatments, compared to the control, lowered soil temperature by 2 °C at 5 cm depth and 0.5 °C at 15 and 25 cm depths. The plastic and straw mulching stored the highest quantity of soil moisture at 5 and 15 cm depths; the bare soil stored the lowest quantity. At 25 cm depth, soil-moisture content was the highest under paper mulch but invariable under the other mulches. Plastic mulching reduced evaporation rate from the soil surface and, consequently, the reduced soil-water consumption (SWC) from the root zone augmented WUE of soybean. The paper mulching, by conserving soil-moisture and reducing soil temperature, provided better crop growth attributes, while the plastic mulching improved WUE of green soybean. Therefore, the plastic mulch performed best in reducing soil-water consumption and increasing WUE, while the paper mulch was good for soil-moisture conservation and temperature modification that increased soybean yield.

The influences of exogenous organic matter (OM) and fertilizer application on the activities of five relevant enzymes (β-glucosaminidase, β-glucosidase, l-glutaminase, urease and arylamidase) were measured in two long-term field experiments. Of the two field experiments, the 18-year field experiment was established in a weathered terrace soil with rice-wheat crop rotation at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU) farm with five OM treatments and two levels of mineral N fertilizer. The 30-year experiment was established in a young floodplain soil with rice-rice crop rotation at the Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) farm with five mineral fertilizer treatments including one with farm yard manure. At BSMRAU, N fertilizer and OM amendments significantly increased all enzyme activities, suggesting the availability of primarily substrate for microbial activity. Whereas at BAU, non-responsiveness of β-glucosidase activity, suggesting that fertilizer and OM amendments had little effect on overall soil microbial activity. Nevertheless the microbial demand for N, β-glucosaminidase and l-glutaminase activities differed among the treatments (P < 0.05) and showed opposite trends with soil N mineralization. Hence enzymatic pathways to acquire N differed with the treatment at BAU site, indicates differences in soil N quality and bio-availability. l-glutaminase activity was the sole investigated variable that positively correlated to both the aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in both field experiments. Combined with a negative correlation between β-glucosaminidase activity and N mineralization rate, it appears that terminal amino acid NH2 hydrolysis was a rate-limiting step for soil N mineralization at the BAU site. Future investigations with joint quantification of polyphenol accumulation and binding of N alongside an array of extracellular enzymes, including oxidases for phenols and hydrolases for N-compounds, would enable verification of the hypothesized binding and stabilization of N with accumulating polyphenols at BAU site under SOM storing management.

Non-perforated plastic mulching reduces effective rainfall by preventing infiltration, while perforated plastic mulching (plastic-hole mulching) increases effective rainfall by enhancing infiltration; both mulching control soil temperature. The comparative performance of these mulching is not, however, well investigated yet. So, a field experiment was conducted by cultivating soybean (Glycine max) under non-perforated plastic mulching (hereafter denoted by P), plastic-hole mulching (hereafter denoted by PH) and bare soil to investigate soil temperature, effective rainfall, total readily available soil moisture (TRAM), soil-moisture extraction pattern (SMEP) and yield of soybean. The mulching treatments reduced soil temperature by 2 °C at 5 cm depth compared to the bare treatment and created a favorable environment for soybean growth under high air temperature during summer in Japan. The PH treatment increased effective rainfall by as much as 9% of total rainfall compared to the P treatment. The SMEP in the 0- to 30-cm soil profile revealed that soil moisture was consumed, mostly, from the upper soil layer in the bare treatment, while in the P and PH treatments, soil-moisture consumption occurred both from the upper and from the lower soil layers. Consequently, the P and PH treatments provided greater TRAM (57.3 and 54.0 mm) than the bare treatment (48.0 mm), indicating that mulching contributed increasing soil-moisture availability in the root zone. The mulching treatments augmented plant height, number of nodulations per plant, and seed and biomass yields; the PH treatment produced the maximum seed yield.

Thus, we examined the effects of two crop establishment systems (minimum soil disturbance by strip planting (SP) or conventional tillage (CT)), two residue retention levels (low and high) and five N rates (60, 80, 100, 120 & 140% of the recommended N fertilizer doses (RFD) on nine consecutive crops on an Aeric Haplaquept under rice-wheat- mungbean sequence. Rice yields were comparable between the crop establishment types but system yields were significantly higher with SP in two out of three years compare to CT. Increased residue retention did not significantly influence rice yield but positively influenced system yields. No substantial differences in optimum N rate was estimated between CT and SP for 90% of maximum yield goal (MYG) for all the three years but substantially decreased in SP compared to CT in two out of three years for 95 and 99% of MYG. The N fertilizer requirement was 6-22% higher with high residue retention compared to low residue retention plots for all the three yield goal levels. High residue retention also increased soil organic carbon (SOC) at 0- 6 cm depth in both tillage treatments. In conclusion, introducing CA did not alter the N fertilizer requirements of rice for 90% of MYG but reduced the requirement for 95 and 99% of MYG compared to CT. However, there was evidence that the retained crop residue immobilized N and increased the fertilizer N requirement.

In this study, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation of inosine monophosphate (IMP) would enhance cellular muscle growth, and upregulate growth-related gene expression in juvenile Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. Five isonitrogenous (40% crude protein) and isocaloric (20.3 KJ/g diet) test diets were formulated by supplementing 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8% IMP in casein and fishmeal based semi-purified diet. Triplicate groups of juvenile Nile tilapia (0.59 ± 0.1 g) were stocked in 15 fiberglass tanks (150 L capacity), arranged in a simple biological filters-based closed system, with stocking density of 25 individuals per tank. The feed was applied at a daily feeding rate of 10% body weight (BW) initially and reduced to 5% BW finally for 60 days. Treatments results were compared using ANOVA (α = 0.05). At 60th day (60 D), final body weight of fish fed with 0.2–0.8% IMP were significantly higher than that of fish fed without IMP supplemented diet. At 60 D, both the hyperplastic (diameter class 10 = ≤ 10 μm) and hypertrophic (diameter class 60 = 50 > d ≤ 60 μm and class 70 = d > 60 μm) muscle fiber frequency were significantly higher in 0.2–0.8% IMP supplemented diets compared to 0–0.1% IMP supplemented diet. Two-way ANOVA result demonstrated that the pituitary GH, hepatic IGF-1 and GHR-1, and muscle-specific MyoD, myogenin and Pax7 gene expression were upregulated in fish fed with 0.2–0.8% IMP compared to the fish fed without IMP supplemented diet. However, hepatic IGF-2 and myostatin gene expression were not significantly affected by the dietary treatments. Real-time PCR data also demonstrated that myostatin gene expression was downregulated and all other gene expression were upregulated at the end of feeding trial (60 D) compared to the initial period (1 D). The results of the present study indicated that IMP supplementation enhanced the muscle growth by promoting hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and upregulating the growth-related gene expression in Nile tilapia. In conclusion, IMP is a potential feed additive and supplementation of ≥ 0.2% IMP is the most effective for enhancing growth of Nile Tilapia.

However, there is a general trend of reducing feed intake and shrimp performance with dietary inclusion of high levels of plant proteins. Supplementation of feed additives could overcome the negative effects of high plant protein based diet. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of different feed additives such as crystalline amino acids (CAA), phytase (PT) and fish soluble (FS) in enhancing the utilization of high levels of plant proteins in the diets of kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus. Six isocaloric diets (19 kJ g− 1) were formulated where diet 1 was 40% fishmeal based control diet (FM). Diets 2 to 6 were prepared as follows, by replacing 60% fishmeal protein with a plant protein blend (soybean meal and canola meal; 6:4) alone (PP); protein blend and 1.5% CAA (PAA); protein blend and 0.04% phytase (2000 FTU kg− 1) (PPT); protein blend and 10% FS (PFS); and protein blend and a mixture of CAA, phytase and FS (PMX) respectively. Triplicate groups of shrimp (1.75 ± 0.40 g; mean initial body weight ± SD) were stocked in 54–l rectangular tanks at a rate of 15 shrimp per tank. The tanks were maintained under natural light/dark regime in a flow-through sea water system. Shrimp were fed the respective test diets at a rate of 8–10% of the body weight daily for 56 days. At the end of the feeding trial, final body weight (g), weight gain (%) and specific growth rate (% day− 1) were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in shrimp fed PP diet. However, these growth parameters recovered when fed diets supplemented with CAA and FS. Although, growth parameters were slightly improved by the supplementation of PT, the differences in growth parameters between FM and PPT were still significant. The fastest growth was found in shrimp fed PMX among the dietary treatments. The growth results were mostly reflected by feed intake (FI). Significantly lowest FI was found in PP group, while similar values were found among the rest. Similarly, protein gain (g kg weight gain− 1) and protein retention (%) were significantly decreased in PP and PPT groups.

The 8-electrode Focused Impedance Method (FIM-8) consists of two concentric and orthogonal linear TPIM systems with their transfer impedances added for the purpose of localizing the central zone. Detailed 3D sensitivity studies are necessary for proper application of the techniques in specific biomedical applications and most reported work present point sensitivity distributions. The present work mainly focuses on planar average sensitivity in planes parallel to the electrode plane and its variation with depth due to different combinations of electrode separations – both for current drive pair and the potential measuring pair. This was obtained through finite element simulation using COMSOL Multiphysics software for a 40x40x40cm3 volume. The results give useful information that can be used to design electrode configurations and measurement modalities for various applications.

Focused Impedance Method (FIM) is a novel technique of electrical impedance measurements which has enhanced sensitivity in a localized region. FIM can sense the change in transfer impedance of an organ within a reasonable depth of the human body using surface electrodes, minimizing contributions from its neighbouring regions. This of course assumes that the impedance properties of the embedded object are different from that of its surrounding tissues. This paper presents a new method for the determination of the volume of an organ within body using dual electrode separations of a concentric 4-electrode FIM configuration. In order to develop this formalism simulated FIM measurements using surface electrodes on a cubic volume conductor with embedded spherical objects were performed using a Finite Element (FE) based simulation software, COMSOL Multiphysics®. For the present methodology, the conductivity of the object with respect to its surroundings and its depth need to be known. The former is obtainable through some primary invasive or in vivo measurements while the latter may be approximated using anatomy. Experimental results on a phantom made up of a cubic tank filled with saline showed that the proposed method can be used to determine the volume of embedded objects to an accuracy of about 5% which is adequate for most physiological measurements. The technique may also find use in geology, oceanography and industry.	Organ Volume, Volume Determination, Focused Impedance Method, FIM, Electrical Impedance	2015-10-01 00:00:00

The zone localization in FIM has been visualized through equipotential distributions, current density at the target point and perturbation produced at the potential measuring electrodes. The predicted behaviour has been verified though phantom measurements and analytical techniques by different groups. FIM is particularly sensitive and useful if the electrical impedance of a target object in the sensitive zone changes between two sets of measurements. This can be either due to a physical change in the target object, or, if its impedance has frequency dependence, through a change in the measurement frequency. In medical applications FIM is being developed for studying stomach and bladder emptying, localized lung function, detection of cervical and oral cancer, etc. FIM may have applications in industry to study physical mixtures of liquids and gases in pipelines and tanks, in geology to detect groundwater and other minerals, in oceanography, and in many other applications. Thus FIM appears to have a huge potential for application in different areas.	Electrical Impedance technique, Focused Impedance Method, Volume conductor	2012-01-01 00:00:00

Along with this discovery, two metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) which derived from L1 and 6- (methoxycarbonyl)pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (L), have also been synthesized and characterized by using combination of spectroscopic techniques such as Infrared (IR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonances (NMR), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Xray crystallography. The formulations of these MOFs are confirmed by elemental analysis with formula molecules given as {[Cd3(L1-CH3)·CH3OH]}n and {[Cd3(LCH3)·H2O]·5H2O}n, respectively. It was revealed from this study that reaction of both ligands with cadmium nitrate led to formation of one-dimensional MOFs. The hydrogen storage properties of these MOFs were investigated by Pressure Composition Temperature (PCT) analysis. The results showed that MOF {[Cd3(L1- CH3)·CH3OH]}n can uptake 0.3wt. % hydrogen at 373 K and 60 bar.

The location information can be obtained through the mobile communication network or the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) [8]. But in all the cases after extracting information we have to make an exhaustive processing over this extracted geographic information. And this exhaustive processing requires a significant amount of time if it is performed by traditional techniques. Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, has been proven to be useful in the interpretation of spatial resource information. On of the artificial intelligence technique to support spatial processing is artificial neural networks (ANNs). The recent developments in ANN technology have made it more ofan applied mathematical technique that has some similarities to the human brain. The integration of LBS with AIoffers a potential mechanismto lower the analysis-time of spatial information. One major advantage is that this integration allows the interpretive result from a small area to be transferred to a larger, geographically similar area. The objective of this paper is to discuss about the relativity of LBS services and Artificial Intelligence technologies and to uncover the benefits of converging LBS and AI.

One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the delivery of highly personalized services. One of the most powerful ways to personalize mobile services is based on location. Location is a key to provide location based services (LBS) to the user because the location information is typically useful for coverage, deployment, routing, location service, target tracking and rescue operations. One of the most obvious technologies behind LBS is positioning, with the most widely recognized system being the Global Positioning System (GPS). There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS. This document provides detail on the design and implementation of a java application which provides the users current location sends this location using SMS (Short Message Service) plus sharing location with friends and family and views them on maps. Users can also take benefit of this application in emergency situations by using emergency feature of this application. To get the location coordinates, application is using GPS (Global Positioning System) as location provider. The application design has five parts: a mobile client, a web server, a database, GPS system and a map service. A mobile client application which consists of a mobile and GPS receiver finds the location of the user to get aware of his location. In order to share this location the mobile client sends this location to the web server from where other users can get this location if they have the authentication provided by the user. The mobile client is implemented using J2ME which is one of the most promising software platforms for mobile devices. Sun representatives assert that 18 to 20 million mobile phones support the J2ME platform. Analysts predict that within the next few years, this technology will become omnipresent.

But, the main hurdle in the mobile handset evolution is that when a user is inside a building there is degradation in the reception of signals. Femtocells have emerged out as a key solution to this problem. Femtocells are low power, indoor base-stations similar to Wi-Fi access points. They connect users with cellular providers via customers’ broadband Internet links, not via telephony infrastructure, thereby eliminating indoor reception problems. Femtocells extend carriers’ wireless networks directly into the homes. With this extension comes the challenge of integrating millions of wireless base stations with the existing mobile infrastructure. There are many different ways of achieving this integration. Among those, IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) based integration method can act as a major option. The purpose of this paper is to identify the issues surrounding this new technology, highlight the major challenges in the deployment of femtocells, give some preliminary ideas to overcome them and to bring forward the major reasons which strengthen the IMS candidature.

This application also enables the users to get their current location coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude) and they can also view their locations on the Google maps. Further, this application also enables the user to share his location with their friends through a web server using internet connectivity in their hand helds. GPS is a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit by the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD). GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. GPS can show you your exact position on the Earth in any weather conditions, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS [6].

The handheld devices used today are much better in performance in terms of processing power and memory than many of the web servers of early times. These handheld devices are also equipped with so many multimedia features that they have become the primary device for people to capture day-to-day occurrences. Moreover, a handheld device is always carried by a person with him wherever he goes. We would try to develop a hybrid model of client-server and peer to peer technologies which would provide spontaneous and instantaneous updates to the peers in the trusted group without actually “pushing” of updates by the user, at the same time, overcoming the limitations of traditional client-server approach of the social networking websites of today.	mobile peer to peer network, mp2p, real-time sharing, spontaneous social networking, ubiquitous networking 	2011-07-01 00:00:00

IEEE	Department of Computer Engineering, Zakir Husain College of Engineering and Technology Aligarh Muslim University, India	maqadeer@gmail.com	This application provides a facility to listen your favorite music anytime, anywhere. It provides live streaming from more than 80 radio stations all around the globe. The application is an audio service transmitted via the Internet. Music streaming on the Internet is usually referred to as web casting since it is not transmitted broadly through wireless means. Internet radio involves streaming media, presenting listeners with a continuous stream of audio that cannot be paused or replayed, much like traditional broadcast media; in this respect, it is distinct from on-demand file serving. Internet radio is also distinct from pod casting, which involves downloading rather than streaming. Many Internet radio services are associated with a corresponding traditional (terrestrial) radio station or radio network. Internet-only radio stations are independent of such associations. Internet radio services are usually accessible from anywhere in the world.	Web radio,net radio,internet radio streaming radio and e-radio	2011-05-01 00:00:00

Users can also take benefit of this application in emergency situations by using emergency feature of this application. To get the location coordinates, application is using GPS (Global Positioning System) as location provider. The application design has five parts: a mobile client, a web server, a database, GPS system and a map service. A mobile client which consists of a mobile and GPS receiver finds the location of the user to get aware of his location. In order to share this location the mobile client sends this location to the web server from where other users can get this location if they have the authentication provided by the user. The mobile client is implemented using J2ME which is one of the most promising software platforms for mobile devices. Sun representatives assert that 18 to 20 million mobile phones support the J2ME platform. Analysts predict that within the next few years, this technology will become omnipresent. According to Gartner Group estimates, in 2006, approximately 80 percent of mobile phones will support Java.

The sniffer captures these packets by setting the NIC card in the promiscuous mode and eventually decodes them and they can be used for several fruitful purposes. This paper discusses the different steps for the development of packet sniffer using Linux as a platform. This paper presents a novel approach to the development of a packet sniffer, one which we have employed and added features for packet analysis and intrusion detection. It also lists different steps that can be taken to encounter the malicious use of packet sniffers (e.g. ARP sniffing, SNMP monitoring etc.). Packet sniffer developed by us can be used for network monitoring to prevent bottlenecks when network congestion occurs. The development phase began after studying the behavior of already existing sniffer softwares such as Wire Shark or Ethereal on both Linux and Windows platform. In the development of the packet sniffer a library known as libpcap is used, which is an in built feature of an OS and help us to grab the packets directly from the network card.

It means basically that each user can buy bandwidth which will be available as a premium, high and normal class bandwidth. As per the class a user buys he will be given a username and password. Using this username and password he will authenticate himself to the server. The server then provides bandwidth to that user for running the applications which fall within the bandwidth range of that class. The server queues all the packets coming to it from the internet connection and then sends them out on a priority basis which is defined by the class each user falls into.

By increasing the number of basic applications and the media that it is possible to combine, it is possible to increase the number of services offered to the end users, and thus to enrich the interpersonal communication experience. IPTV is a system used to deliver digital television services to the consumers through broadband. This delivery of digital television is made possible by using Internet Protocol over a broadband connection, usually in a managed network rather than the public Internet to preserve quality of service guarantees. The Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem, better known as "The IMS", is based on the specification of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IMS is an architecture for the convergence of data, speech and mobile networks and is based on a wide range of protocols, of which most have been developed by the IETF. It combines and enhances them to allow real time services on top of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) packet-switched domain. This paper presents what IPTV is, its requirements, how IPTV will be merged with IMS and various standardization efforts for IPTV. It further also deals the advantage of IMS based IPTV, its implementation challenges, performance and capacity, and testing requirement.

Dynamic MDCT has a very promising role as diagnostic tool in breast cancer patients. This study aimed to emphasize the role of 64 MDCT in the work up of breast cancer. Between October 2012 to April 2014, 100 consecutive patients with suspicious breast lesions underwent bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound and dynamic MDCT. We evaluated the primary lesion morphology, pattern of enhancement with the time enhancement curve, extensions, lymph nodal status, and metastasis in lung or chest wall. Tumor staged based on the TNM classification. In the studied 100 patients, MDCT detects 107 mass lesions; 64 were malignant and 43 were benign. The collected imaging data were correlated with the surgical and pathologic findings in all patients. Breast dynamic MDCT with the pattern of the time enhancement curve was found to be accurate in diagnosing and lesion characterization, the sensitivity was 93%, specificity was 89%, and accuracy was 91%. Dynamic MDCT should be considered as a feasible non invasive imaging tool for the diagnosis and work up in patients with breast cancer.	64-MDCT breast cancer diagnosis	2015-03-01 00:00:00

Several sentiment analysis systems are proposed to determine the opinions of customers about products and product features. However, the aggregation methods used are not able to estimate a true reputation value and to reflect the recent opinions quickly. Most of these systems are based on single source and therefore suffer from availability and susceptibility issues. In this paper, we propose a multi-source reputation model where several aggregation methods are introduced in order to evaluate product based on features. In addition, we also propose a method which uses four parameters in order to rank the reputability of each rating before considering it for reputation values. The results show that the proposed model estimates good reputation values even in the presence of biased behaviors, robust to false ratings and reflects the newest opinions about product rapidly.

Measuring similarity or distance between GO terms is a key step for determining hidden relationship between genes. The notion of similarity between GO terms is a usual step in knowledge discovery related tasks. In literature various similarity measures between GO terms have been proposed. We have introduced a novel similarity measure scheme to improve three conventional similarity measures to reduce their limitations. The salient feature of the proposed GO Semantic Similarity (gSemSim) measure is its ability to show more realistic similarity between concepts in perspective of domain knowledge. A comparative result with other technique has also been presented that showing an improved contextual meaning of the proposed semantic similarity. This study is expected to assist the community of bio informaticians in the selection of better similarity measure required for correct annotations of genes in gene ontology.

The polarity identification of sentences is a challengeable task, especially when one or more conjunctions appear. In the presence of conjunction, it is required to identify which part of the sentence contributes to the overall sentiment expressed. This work analyzes the role of conjunction and investigates the problem of determining the polarity of compound sentences, i.e., when conjunction appears in a sentence. A classification of the most frequent conjunctions is introduced and rules for each class are proposed to determine sentiment at both sentence level and feature level. The method we propose in this paper is also able to handle negation. Two sets of experiments are performed to test the effectiveness. The accuracy of this method at sentence level and feature level is better than the accuracy of existing methods.	sentiment analysis; opinion mining; conjunction analysis; conjunction rules; compound sentences.	2013-01-01 00:00:00

These results in many recent developments, like OntoKhoj, Swoogle, OntoSearch2, that facilitate tasks user have to perform. These semantic web portals mainly treat ontologies as plain texts and use the traditional text classification algorithms for classifying ontologies in directories and assigning predefined labels rather than using the semantic knowledge hidden within the ontologies. These approaches suffer from many types of classification problems and lack of accuracy, especially in the case of overlapping ontologies that share common vocabularies. In this paper, we define an ontology classification problem and categorize it into many sub-problems. We present a new ontological methodology for the classification of web ontologies, which has been guided by the requirements of the emerging Semantic Web applications and by the lessons learnt from previous systems.

In this paper, we have presented an exclusive multi-server scheduling algorithm that is specifically tuned for mobile routers equipped with multiple wireless interfaces and has attained multiple care-of-address registrations with its home agent (HA). The proposed adaptive, Self-clocked, Multi-server (ASM) scheduling algorithm is based on predetermined transmission deadlines for each arrived packet at the mobile router. The mobile flows receive desired service levels in accordance with their negotiated service rates and are only constraint by the cumulative capacity of all active links. The major challenge lies in the handling of asymmetric channels to stitch into a unified virtual channel of higher capacity with reliable service guarantees during mobility. The sorted list of transmission schedules is used to assign physical channels in increasing order of their availability. This approach specifically encapsulates the physical layer disconnections during the handovers and ensures continuous service to ongoing flows. The proposed scheduling scheme is supplemented by an analytical model and simulations to verify its efficacy. The simulation results demonstrate higher degree of reliability and scalability of service provisioning to flows during mobility.

Reusing of already retrieved data depends on finding the containment of new queries with the older/stored queries. Advantages of semantic cache query processing (Satisfiablity and implication in database domain) have already been demonstrated in the published literature. Description Logic (DL ) has never been applied for checking relational query subsumption/containment. Sound and Complete subsumption algorithms exist for reasoning facts represented in Description Logic. DL is a formalism used to model knowledge of a domain in the form of concepts and a rich set of associations between these concepts. Reasoning on the knowledge base can be performed in order to discover implicit relations. The most important reasoning is the determination of a subsumption relation between the logical expressions. Relational queries are also a form of knowledge description. In this paper, we discuss Subsumption analysis of semantic cache query processing and its advantages in semantic cache query management by using tableau algorithms of DL. In particular, Subsumption algorithms are used to perform reasoning from the previously stored queries in the semantic cache. Query containment can be found by transforming relational queries into DL. Based upon this reasoning, a query can be divided into cache (probe) and server (remainder) queries. This will not only contribute towards cache query processing but have a significant contribution in the cache management, too. Previously, the implication and satisfiablity techniques in database domain were handling only conjunctive queries. In our algorithms, we handle disjunctive queries, too.

But, as the semantic web is gaining much popularity, there is a massive growth seen in the ontology development which poses new research challenges such as ontology classification, ranking, searching, retrieval, etc. This results many recent developments, like OntoKhoj, Swoogle, OntoSearch, that facilitate user for such tasks. These semantic web portals mainly treat ontologies as plain texts and use traditional classification algorithms of plain text for classifying ontologies in directories and assigning predefined labels rather than using semantic knowledge hidden within the ontologies. These approaches suffer with many types of classification problems and lack of accuracy, especially in the case of overlapping ontologies that share common vocabularies. In this paper, we define ontology classification problem and categorized it into many sub-problems. We present a new methodology for ontology classification that is based on ontology approach for ontology classification and retrieval. The proposed framework, ONTCLASSIFIRE, benefit construction, maintenance or expansion of ontologies directories on the semantic web, and helps in ontology management and retrieval for software agents and people. We conclude that the use of context specific knowledge hidden in ontologies gives more accurate results of ontology classification and retrieval.

To generate such a global ontology automatically, the individual ontologies must be free of (all types of) errors. We have observed that the present error classification does not include all the errors. This paper extends the existing error classification (Inconsistency, Incompleteness and Redundancy) and provides a discussion about the consequences of these errors. We highlight the problems that we faced while developing our DKP-OM, ontology merging system and explain how these errors became obstacles in efficient ontology merging process. It integrates the ontological errors and design anomalies for content evaluation of ontologies under one framework. This framework helps ontologists to build semantically correct ontology free from errors that enables effective and automatic ontology mapping and merging with lesser user intervention.

IEEE	Center for Distributed and Semantic Computing Mohammad Ali Jinnah University Islamabad Pakistan	aqadir@jinnah.edu.pk	Terminal Mobility is a much more common activity today then it was anticipated a few years back. Mobility itself is a complex phenomenon which is further complicated in a distributed application environment due to abstraction of cross-platform details and cross-realm handoffs. CORBA is a widely used middleware service used for remote method invocation in distributed applications. Vertical handoffs in cross-realm environment puts a serious constraint on effective resolution of resource names and hence CORBA utility in mobile heterogeneous environment. We propose a robust middleware architecture which takes into account multiple access services at link-layer performs optimization of connectivity services at middleware with the help of decision making support provided by application needs and network status. The proposed architecture promises resilient middleware services for terminal mobility.

Current systems for ontology mapping and merging are very restricted in term of resolving mismatches or proposing accurate matches with no or minimum human intervention. The suggestions made by these systems do not consider all information available in the semantic knowledge of the ontologies. In this paper we are proposing a system for merging and alignment of OWL-DL ontologies that uses semantics of concepts especially the disjoint knowledge in order to resolve conflicts automatically. We show that in order to provide a complete, consistent and coherent merged ontology, preservation of disjoint knowledge in the definition of ontologies is very helpful. Our system uses heuristics-based approach for mapping concepts of ontologies by analyzing description logic (DL) of concepts and preserves the disjoint knowledge in the merged ontology, too. The concept of validation during the initial stages of ontology mapping not only distinguishes our system from the existing ones’ but also reduces the users’ dependability for validating the consistency of the generated mappings. We also discuss experimental findings to prove the effectiveness of our approach in merging process.

Annotation can be done either manually or automatically. The retrieval performance of the manual annotation based approaches is quite good, as compared to approaches based on automatic annotation. However, manual annotation is time consuming and labor extensive. Therefore, it is quite difficult to apply this technique on huge volume of multimedia data. On the other hand, automatic annotation is commonly used to annotate the multimedia data based on low level features, which obviously lacks the semantic nature of the multimedia data. Yet, we have not come across with any such system which automatically annotate the multimedia data based on the extracted semantics accurately. In this paper, we have performed automatic annotation of the images by extracting their semantics (high level features) with the help of semantic libraries. Semantic libraries use semantic graphs. Each graph consists of related concepts along with their relationships. We have also demonstrated with the help of a case study that our proposed approach ensures an improvement in the semantic based retrieval of multimedia data.	automatic annotation, content-based image retrieval, multimedia database architecture, image abstract extraction, semantic libraries	2007-01-01 00:00:00

Most of the proposed architectures and solutions for mobility management use complex processing to reduce handoff latencies. In this paper a light-weight fast mobility management scheme is proposed which is based on strategic deployment of wireless LAN (WLAN) hotspots in a hierarchy of overlapped components like handoff anchor points (HAP), access routers (ARs) and access points (APs). The major handoff decision is taken in the HAP, a novel component in proposed architecture, which last for a significantly longer time due to reduced chances in probable moving path and by sending early binding updates through active ARs. Handoff latency has been reduced to almost link layer handoff time with a high level of predictability and reliability. Simulation results highlight improvements achieved in throughput, scalability, and handoff latencies.

Different variants of TCP have been proposed which show varying degree of resilience in best effort IP networks characteristics. Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) has proven strength in providing quality of service based data services due to its traffic engineering procedures. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental analysis of TCP variants under MPLS with emphasis on Tahoe, Reno and Vegas. Under different traffic load, it has been found that Reno and Tahoe fail to take advantage of MPLS features where as Vegas has shown promising results with almost stable constant end-to-end delay after a transient phase of delay fluctuations in the early stages of data transmission session. The stable end-to-end delay under MPLS makes Vegas an attractive choice for medium to large size real-time traffic.	TCP Vegas,Reno,Tahoe,MPLS,CBR,Congestion	2007-01-01 00:00:00

IEEE	Center for Distributed and Semantic Computing Mohammad Ali Jinnah University Islamabad Pakistan	aqadir@jinnah.edu.pk	Around the world, academic institutions, professional associations and corporations are striving to make better use of networks and databases to efficiently and effectively achieve learning and professional development goals. One of the ways chosen to pursue these goals is to make learning resources readily accessible to educators and learners through learning object repositories. Therefore, the use of information technologies to create new learning resources, manage the existing ones and aggregate learning content from a wide variety of academic and publishing sources, will affect teaching and learning by automating these processes, considerably bringing down its cost and cutting short on the time required to prepare learning materials. UREKA learning-object taxonomy & repository architecture - ULTRA, a part of UREKA - an education multimedia database, defines learning object repository (LOR) that is an easy-to-use and standards-based learning object repository that can store, share, reuse and classify learning objects (LOs), digital assets (e.g. movies, animations, images, etc.) and other content objects. In this paper the authors defined the architecture of ULTRA that not only classifies and stores learning objects but also facilitates in the process of metadata collection using profiles.

IEEE	Center for Distributed and Semantic Computing Mohammad Ali Jinnah University Islamabad Pakistan	aqadir@jinnah.edu.pk	Greater network latencies and swelling amount of data provide sound reason for semantic caching for multi-db environment. Properly implemented Semantic caches, provide better solution as compared to ordinary caches, as they have ability to quickly infer whether the query can be satisfied by the cache or not, due to the organization of the cache. Increasing amount of data and data intensive applications on the network, user queries may spend lots of computational resources, these requirements swells cache size, along with the increasing overheads of storage and retrieval of query semantics. We need to devise an efficient indexing scheme that is able to fetch the cache semantics precisely and at a fast rate for increasing efficiency of the semantic cache and to cope up with current querying pressures. This research proposes a hierarchical indexing scheme that is significantly efficient to serve the purpose of fast semantic cache.

IEEE	Center for Distributed and Semantic Computing Mohammad Ali Jinnah University Islamabad Pakistan	aqadir@jinnah.edu.pk	Context is the "circumstances and conditions" which "surround" an event. Various areas of computer science, mainly, semantic Web have been investigating the concept of context aware information retrieval for the past few years. Context aware information retrieval involves, either, building refined queries that can retrieve most relevant and precise information or refining retrieved results to match user's needs. Currently most of the queries processed on the web do not return the desired results because they fail to take into account the user's context, query relevance, user's intent, current location, time, and other user's preferences in combination. This leads to high recall and low relevance. Different architectures have been proposed in this field. However, there is still lot more to be done to achieve the results in the areas of query refinement, context retrieval and result refinement. Our approach is based on a proposed concept of 'role ontology' and 'query schemas', incorporating user's profile, context, history, ontology's and user feedback.

There is limitation in clinical studies that have addressed the beneficial effects of weight reduction in modulating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and adipokines dysregulation for obesity associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was designed to detect the effects of weight loss on insulin resistance, adhesive molecules and adipokines dysregulation in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Eighty obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, their age ranged from 35-55 years and their body mass index ranged from 31-37 kg/m2  were equally assigned into 2 groups:  the weight reduction group received aerobic exercises in addition to diet regimen, where the control group received medical treatment only for 12 weeks. There was a 24.04%, 19.33%, 22.78% ,12.28%, 9.35%, 22.53% & 10.12 % reduction in mean values of Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR), Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin & body mass index (BMI) respectively in addition to 26.20% & 24.58% increase in the mean values of adiponectin & the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) respectively in group (A) at the end of the study. The mean values of leptin, resistin, insulin, HOMA-IR, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin & BMI were significantly decreased in addition to significant increase in the mean values of adiponectin & QUICKI in group (A) those that received aerobic exercise training in addition to diet regimen. While the results of group (B) those that received no treatment intervention were not significant. In addition, there were significant differences between mean levels of the investigated parameters in group (A) and group (B) after treatment (P<0.05).

Previous cohort studies indicated that obesity increases risk of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in non-diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis C infection due to diminished response to anti-viral therapy and as a result obesity is considered as an important factor in the progression of chronic HCV. However, there is a strong association between BMI and the human immune system among HCV patients. This study aimed to examine effects of weight reduction program on selected immune parameters among HCV Saudi patients. One-hundred obese Saudi patients with chronic HCV infection participated in this study, their age ranged from 50- 58 years and their body mass index (BMI) ranged from 30-35 kg/m2. All Subjects were included in two groups: The first group received weight reduction program in the form of treadmill aerobic exercises in addition to diet control whereas, the second group received no therapeutic intervention.

Physical exercise is a potential strategy for improving the immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation that accompanies aging. However, there is a need to differentiate between aerobic and resistance exercise training regarding human immune system and systemic inflammation among the elderly Saudi population. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of 6 months of aerobic versus resisted exercise training on inflammatory cytokines and immune system response among elderly. Sixty previously sedentary elderly subjects participated in this study, their age ranged from 61- 66 years. All Subjects were randomly assigned to supervised aerobic exercise intervention group (group A, n=40) or resistance exercise group (group B, n=40). Number of CD3+,CD4+,CD8+ T cells count and CD4/CD8 ratio were quantified, IL-6, TNF-α and IL10 were measured before and after 6 months, at the end of the study. The current study provides evidence that aerobic exercise is more appropriate in modulating the immune system and inflammatory markers among the elderly population.

Despite progress in therapy, SCA remains a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. The relationship between exercise and immune function has been of great interest to the scientific community and the lay public. The aim of this study was to measure the impact of aerobic exercise training on the immunologic parameters and inflammatory cytokines of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) in asymptomatic steady state. Sixty asymptomatic sickle cell anemia patients were involved in this study, their age ranged from 25- 40 years and were assigned to two sub-groups; group (A) received aerobic exercise training for 12 weeks, however group (B) received no training intervention for 12 weeks. Parameters of CD3, CD4 and CD8 were quantified, Leukocyte, differential counts, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured before and after 12 weeks, at the end of the study.

Although, these abnormalities could be modulated with weight reduction; there is limitation in clinical studies that have addressed the beneficial effects of weight reduction in modulating biomarkers of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress for obesity associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.This study was designed to detect the effects of weight loss on the inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers in obese type 2 diabetic patients.Eighty obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, their age ranged from 35-57 years and their body mass index ranged from 31-35 kg/m2 were equally assigned into 2 groups: the weight reduction group received aerobic exercises, diet regimen, where as the control group received medical treatment only for 12 weeks.The mean values of body mass index (BMI), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (sCRP), conjugated dienes (CD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly decreased, while the mean values of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) were significantly increased in patients of group (A), while changes were not significant in group (B).

Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of metabolic complications in obese type 2 diabetic subjects. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of aerobic versus resistance training on insulin resistance, adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokine in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Forty obese type 2 diabetic patients of both sexes with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 31 to 35 kg/m2, non smokers, and free from respiratory, kidney, liver, metabolic and neurological disorders, were selected for this study. Their ages ranged from 34 to 56 years. The subjects were divided into two equal groups: the first group received aerobic exercise training. The second group (B) received resisted exercise training three times a week for three months. The mean values of tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL-6), Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA) index for insulin sensitivity and glycosylated hemoglobin (HBA1c), were significantly decreased in both groups. Also, there was a significant difference between the groups after treatment on all measured variables. It is suggested that in obese type 2 diabetic patients aerobic exercise is more appropriate for modulating insulin resistance, adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokine levels than is resisted exercise training.

Databases (Pubmed, OVID , Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched. Seven studies were selected for inclusion. Only one was a randomized controlled trial. In total, 208 children were administered antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis. Four reports of mild adverse events were documented (1.9% of treated children), one of which discontinued treatment (0.5%). Limitations of this review are the lack of randomized controlled trials available in pediatric onychomycosis. These findings suggest that antifungal therapies used to treat onychomycosis in children are associated with a low incidence of adverse events. Current dosing regimens for antifungal drugs are effective and appear safe to use in children, notwithstanding that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of these agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. To our knowledge, this review is the most up‐to‐date, comprehensive summary of pediatric onychomycosis treatment.	adverse events; children; onychomycosis; oral therapy; topical therapy	2018-06-01 00:00:00

Fungi are traditionally understood as existing in the environment as planktonic organisms; however, recent advancements in microbiology suggest that fungi form biofilms–complex sessile microbial communities irreversibly attached to epithelial surfaces by means of an extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix also acts as a protective barrier to the organisms within the biofilm. The biofilm is surprisingly resistant to injury and may act as a persistent source of infection possibly accounting for antifungal resistance in onychomycosis.	antifungal,biofilm,dermatophyte fungi,extracellular matrix,nail,onychomycosis	2018-04-01 00:00:00

Although this is a reasonable action for many clinicians, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy of topical prophylaxis. A retrospective chart review (2010–2015) was conducted in patients receiving oral terbinafine or itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Following complete cure, a topical antifungal (amorolfine, bifonazole, ciclopirox olamine, or terbinafine spray) was used weekly as prophylaxis. Recurrence was recorded along with patient characteristics including demographics and concomitant medical conditions. Data from 320 patients were collected. Recurrence was significantly lower in patients receiving topical antifungal prophylaxis than in no prophylactic treatment following oral terbinafine (p  < .001), but not itraconazole (p  = .185). Regardless of oral treatment, the use of topical antifungals as prophylaxis (p  < .001) decreased, and the number of affected toenails (p  = .048) and family history of fungal infections (p  < .001) increased the likelihood that recurrence would occur. This study supports the use of topical antifungal medications as prophylactic treatment to help prevent recurrence of toenail onychomycosis and suggests that those with a family history of fungal infections should be closely monitored.	efficacy; prophylaxis; tinea unguium	2017-08-01 00:00:00

The high incidence of relapse and reinfection often makes onychomycosis a chronic condition. The current gold standard is oral therapy, but the development of effective topical agents remains a priority as they have fewer systemic interactions. This review summarizes development of antifungals from early phase development through Phase III clinical trials for onychomycosis. The oral molecules in development are azole molecules. Topical drugs in development include azoles, allylamines, benzoxaboroles and nanoemulsions. Photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy and new laser systems are also emerging therapeutic options. There is a diverse array of antifungal drugs in the early phases of development. The goals of onychomycosis therapy are a mycological cure and a normal appearing nail. The recent development of topical antifungals has been successful at improving the nail permeation and efficacy. The diversification of molecular targets is the next primary goal of antifungal development. Incomplete treatment of onychomycosis provides an environment conducive to the development of antifungal resistance. New topical agents and device-based therapies expand the therapeutic options. Combination therapy using multiple drug classes may improve the overall efficacy of antifungal treatment in onychomycosis. 	allylamine, antifungal, azole, dermatophyte, non-dermatophyte mold, onychomycosis	2014-12-01 00:00:00

In this, a set of decoy labeled peptides are injected to the database and indexed along with real peptides. Crux Tide is a fast search engine that supports indexing peptides' database and decoys generation. In Tide, indexing FASTA files and generating decoys is a computationally expensive process. In this paper we first analyze the serial Tide indexer and decoy generator algorithm and, then describe a parallel shared memory solution. Our proposed technique utilizes a clever hashing technique to localize the process, and breaks up the processing dependency among threads. The developed parallel versions are able to reduce the computational complexity by approximately 50% and 25% of the sequential time using 4 and 8 threads, respectively.

IEEE	Computer Science Department, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, USA	ajay.gupta@wmich.edu	Analyzing datasets for Risky Decision Making (RDM) is a challenging task involving the identification of varied decision making patterns and the categorization of individuals. Researchers from various fields as diverse as psychology and marketing are actively working to identify suitable techniques, which will allow understanding decision making processes better. Researchers have commonly used machine learning algorithms to model decision making processes. However, the high computational costs of most machine learning algorithms make such endeavors challenging for increasingly large datasets. One of the most promising approaches is to use ensemble clustering for RDM analysis. Ensemble clustering is computationally intensive and thus we propose to improve its performance. Our study reveals that computational overhead is introduced through the use of dimensions in ensemble cluster RDM analyses. Improving performance requires more than the parallelization of individual clustering techniques of the ensemble. We therefore propose a FIFO queue based implementation for analyzing RDM datasets using a HPC cluster on a distributed system. Our technique is able to achieve almost a linear speedup (e.g. 44.79x using 48 MPI threads). Possible shortcomings of the proposed method, opportunities for future work, and alternative parallelization scenarios are also discussed in this paper.	ensemble clustering application,machine learning,MPI,multi objective optimization,parallel distributed processing,risky decision making	2016-07-01 00:00:00

Sci., Western Michigan Univ., Kalamazoo, MI	gupta@cs.wmich.edu	Current trends in computing indicate that there is a great potential for service oriented computing and similar technologies, such as Cisco's Application Oriented Networks, where services provide a higher-level of abstraction to traditional applications. In such cases, providing and consuming services and establishing a relationship between consumers (users of services) and producers (providers of services) are still challenging and vastly researched aspects. We define a service location planning problem (SLP) that is novel in the approach it takes to match consumers to producers, such that the cost of providing services is minimized while taking into account quality of service constraints of throughput and delay. In previous work, we presented an integer linear programming (ILP) model to formulate the service location planning problem. In this paper, we present Lagrangean Relaxation of the model for large-scale networks. We use the approach of Trick [3] to decrease computational overheads.

Sci., Western Michigan Univ., Kalamazoo, MI	gupta@cs.wmich.edu	Numerous approaches have been proposed for intrusion detection in immobile networks. However, little research work has been done in actually implementing them, especially for anomaly detection, in mobile networks. In this paper, we present an efficient mobility-pattern-based (MPB) anomaly detection algorithm. It can effectively identify abnormal mobility patterns of the nodes in mobile networks. In the proposed algorithm, the normal mobility profile of a specific node is characterized by a multi-leaf tree structure in which each node corresponds to a possible destination cluster. A normal mobility profile is generated during the training process through data mining and fuzzy logic techniques. More specifically, data mining techniques are used for cluster classifications, and fuzzy logic techniques are used to integrate the 'similar'' pattern strings after the corresponding cluster generation. These two techniques are also used during the testing process for distinguishing abnormal mobility patterns of the node from those of the normal in mobile networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MPB anomaly detection algorithm can achieve good performance in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate for nodes with regular movement behaviors by fine tuning the design parameter - threshold, that can be chosen efficiently.	telecommunication security, data mining, fuzzy logic, mobile radio, false alarm rate, mobile networks, intrusion detection, mobility-pattern-based anomaly detection algorithm, multileaf tree structure, fuzzy logic techniques	2008-06-01 00:00:00

In this paper, we use FFT computation as a vehicle to highlight the issues involved in realizing distributed computations over sensor networks that have global and local communication and synchronization characteristics. We present a power efficient algorithm for computing 1-D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) over single and multi-hop wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of transmissions, eliminates typical redundant computations in a distributed FFT algorithm and uniformly maps complex multiplications over all the sensors nodes by introducing an extra bit-complement permutation stage after first (log2N)/2 iterations. We show that the proposed algorithm improves energy
consumption by 36% on the average on multi-hop sensor networks. This saving in energy consumption significantly improves the battery life of the sensor nodes thereby
increasing lifetime of the sensor network. 	Computer networks,Fast Fourier transforms,Wireless sensor networks,Signal processing algorithms,Distributed computing,Sensor phenomena and characterization,Intelligent sensors,Collaboration,Power engineering computing,Sensor arrays	2006-03-01 00:00:00

Several iterative approaches employing distributed computations over sensors have been proposed in the literature for locating all the sensor nodes in the network. Due to their iterative nature these techniques are inefficient in terms of power, a very precious resource in sensor networks. This paper presents a novel power efficient approach aimed at identifying the locations of all the nodes in a sensor network given the location of a small subset of nodes. The technique, using evolution strategies, is independent of the ranging method used to estimate distances between nodes and involves sink nodes in the computation. The proposed approach provides substantial energy savings over existing techniques while providing comparable accuracy, and requires the presence of at least one neighbor for each sensor node compared to at least 3 neighbors for most of the existing techniques	sensor networks, localization, evolution, strategies	2005-10-01 00:00:00

Sci., Western Michigan Univ., Kalamazoo, MI	gupta@cs.wmich.edu	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are envisioned to be used in a wide variety of applications for deep monitoring of the
surroundings. Their deployment in hostile environments, however, faces many security challenges. Wireless communication is inherently broadcast and insecure. If WSNs
are deployed in unregulated environments, an adversary can easily tamper with them or compromise some nodes. Sensor
nodes are severely resource constrained in terms of power, memory and processing abilities. Achieving security for these
networks is thus a challenging task. Sensor networks typically follow specific communication patterns. Effective security
primitives can thus be provided by taking the application specific nature of WSNs into consideration. In this paper we
propose a simple, lightweight and scalable protocol, Information Authentication in Sensor Networks (IASN) that can aid in
providing information (high level data) authentication. IASN is able to detect and filter a significant number of forged packets at
low cost.	sensor network, information authentication, routing data, forged packet, wireless communication, effective security primitive, achieving security, scalable protocol, significant number, unregulated environment, wide variety, application specific nature, high level data, sensor node, many security challenge, specific communication pattern, hostile environment, low cost, deep monitoring, challenging task, abstract wireless sensor network, processing ability	2004-01-01 00:00:00

Security becomes a major challenge because of ad-hoc and resource constrained nature of sensor networks. In this paper we present a scalable and distributed security protocol, DSPS, for WSN that fits in between the network and the transport layers. DSPS satisfies the essential
requirements of secure communication such as Data Confidentiality, Data Authentication, Data Integrity and Data Freshness. Basic building blocks of our security protocol are Key Generation-Distribution and Signatures. The key is a 56-bit random number generated initially by a key server, which is then securely distributed to all the nodes in the cluster. This key is used for encryption. DSPS also supports security critical
transactions by dynamically generating a key, which can be shared between two nodes. The simplicity of DSPS allows compatibility with most of the routing protocols. 	component, wireless sensor networks, security protocols	2003-11-01 00:00:00

In particular, we describe an efficient embedding of a complete ternary tree (k = 3) of height h into a hypercube, which achieves dilation 3 and expansion Θ(1.0104...h). The previously best-known result is dilation 2 and expansion Θ(1.333...h). Our embedding achieves exponentially better expansion at the cost of an increase of 1 in the dilation. We also describe efficient embeddings of k-ary trees into hypercubes when k = 2p * 3q for some p, q > 0 such that the embeddings achieve small constant dilation.

These arise in many applications such as computational chemistry, high energy physics and finite element problems. We use a hierarchical architecture which is highly scalable and allows parallelization not only at the domain level but also at the integral level. We present experimental results on a family of parametrized integrals and show that our approach leads to an efficient scalable load balanced algorithm.

An adaptive algorithm attempts to achieve the requested accuracy by refining the subdivision of the integration region, thus allowing for a concentration of subdivisions near singularities. At the subdivision of a region, the error behaves according to a prescribed model, relating the error of the parent region to that of its children. The analysis can also be applied to problems in other areas, as long as the task selection is based on a priority function which behaves according to a suitable model. Using an efficient management of the subregions, we show that an O(p/logp) speedup can be achieved on a p-processor hypercubic network, such as shuffle exchange, butterfly and hypercube. Furthermore, a speedup of O(p) can be achieved on a p×p mesh network. We also show that our algorithms compare favorably with well-known dynamic load balancing strategies.

As witnessed by historical time disasters and their management, the disaster governance in India was primarily of contingency management approach. Codes, practices and guidelines for preparedness and particularly on relief existed even before Independence. However, with the growing understanding on risk causes, the paradigm shift to prevention-mitigation and now on mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into development forms a key agenda in development governance. Legal and policy framework has given rise and mandates to key institutions for policy guidelines, capacity development and emergency response at national, subnational and local levels. Laws directly and indirectly addressing disaster-related hazards and factors of vulnerability and capacity have been reviewed besides opportunities, resources, and responsibilities of organizations/agencies stated herein. Mechanisms of financial strategies, international cooperation and recent advances are discussed, besides the journey of disaster management governance in India.

The recent recurring drought in the Bundelkhand region has alarmed the scientific community and the policy makers alike. The absence of appropriate scientific work to analyse the recurring pattern of the drought, and the relation between meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought has further perplexed the decision makers. The study was an attempt to fill this knowledge gap by using Geoinformatics and other established tools of drought monitoring. Range of indices on drought monitoring has been applied to analyse the nature of the droughts and calculate their frequency and intensity and composite drought. The report ends with innovative presentation of hazard, vulnerability and composite risk map of the region to educate the readers and the decision makers about the recurring nature of the meteorological drought and its impact on hydrological and agricultural systems.

Disaster Management Act, 2005, provided a holistic paradigm of multi-hazard disaster management framework, provision “disaster management plan” at national, state and district (and also local) levels. As per the Vulnerability Atlas (1997, revised in 2006) compiled by the Building Material Technology Promotion Council of India, 241 districts of India have been identified as multi-hazard districts. Reportedly there are 294 districts with Major Accident Hazard (MAH) units. More than 100 such districts with MAH units are also multi-hazard districts. However, lack of integration has prevailed between the disaster management plan and the off-site emergency plan in most of such districts. The present paper attempts to identify the gaps in both off-site plan and DM Plan of Sambalpur district (Orissa) as an example to assess the challenges as well as possible strategies of developing integration in the two plans under the present National Disaster Management Framework.

Mumbai flood 2005 followed by other major cities of South Asia like Dhaka, Islamabad, Rawalpindi also suffered with urban flooding. Census 2001 figured 285 million people in 35 metro cities of India, and is estimated to cross 600 million with 100 metro cities in 2021. Regional ecological challenges coupled with climatic variability are noted to aggravate flood risks and impact on affected communities. Urban flooding was primarily a concern of municipal and environmental governance, has now attained the status of ‘disaster’, which has drawn the attention of environmental scientists and disaster managers. Challenges of urban flooding in terms of drainage and flood mitigation including structural and non-structural measures and key issues of urban ecology in two major metropolitan cities of India – Bangalore and Chennai, have been studied.

Other South Asian cities like Dhaka, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, besides many other cities in India, are also reportedly been affected by frequent floods. Flood risk in urban areas are attributed to hazards accelerated by growth in terms of population, housing, paved-up areas, waste disposal, vehicles, water use, etc. all contributing to high intensity – high load of runoff. Reduced carrying capacity of drainage channels is also a key concern. Haphazard growth of lowincome habitations and un-organised trade added to challenge. Spatial dimensions of all these flood factors are often characterised by land-use and changes. Chennai, a coastal mega-city is fourth largest metropolis in India, has a history of over 350 years of growth. Meteorologically there is no major upward or downward trend of rainfall during 200 years, and a decrease in last 20 years with a contrast record of increasing floods have been experienced. Analysis of land-use changes over the temporal and spatial scale has been undertaken for Chennai city in order to understand the patterns on greencover, built-up area and consequences on hydrological settings. Land-use issues like decreased natural areas, loss of water bodies, encroachment of river/streams and other drainage channels, uncontrolled multiplication of built-up areas, have been identified as contributory factor to flood risk in Chennai. The paper discusses flood risk reduction and management strategies in urban context with example of the Chennai city and draws attention of land-use planners and disaster management experts to integrate their efforts for better and sustainable results.

Cleaner production is a concept that goes beyond simple pollution control and hence, its objectives cannot be ensured unless (a) risks of environmental threats (accidental chemical reactions, release of hazardous gases/contamination, and/or liquids/untreated effluents, etc.) triggered by a probable technological mishap or a natural calamity and (b) existing background level of pollution/contamination and ecological sensitivity are taken into account while selecting a suitable site for developing an industrial complex. Development of industrial growth centres (IGCs) has been initiated in India to accommodate a range of small and medium scale industries that are the major contributors to the economies in developing countries. Selection of safer sites for IGCs, thus, has become a serious concern because of synchronous activities, synergistic pollution effects and risks of accidental releases and discharges. The paper discusses the adverse effects of potential interaction between natural risk factors and industrial systems, highlights regional risk management issues and the role of proper site selection in establishing IGCs. Reviewing the current efforts of industrial siting and developmental planning, a new tool ‘environmental risk mapping’ to guide the planning process regarding the development of IGCs has been proposed and its operational framework has been delineated. Further planning issues for suggested IGC sites and the role of the proposed approach in regional environmental impact assessment and environmental management planning have also been analyzed while summarizing the expected benefits over the current practices. Although the proposed approach has been developed for application in India, its usefulness can be claimed in many developing countries as there predominates a diversity of geophysiographic features, as well as regional proneness to many natural and technological hazards.

The EEC brings significant changes in the surface productivity in the equatorial region influencing the life style of the surface and deep-sea fauna. This study is aimed at understanding ~ 300 Kyr record (~ 450–150 Kyrs ago) of productivity changes linked to variations in IEW–EEC in the equatorial Indian Ocean using high resolution microfaunal record from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Hole 716A, Maldives Ridge. In total, 451 core samples of 10 cm3 volume from the ~ 300 Kyr long sequence (ranging ~ 450–150 Kyrs ago) were analyzed at every 1 cm interval to generate census data of the benthic foraminiferal fauna. Factor and cluster analyses using percentages of 53 highest-ranked benthic foraminiferal species were run that enabled us to identify five biofacies, indicating the varied nature of deep-sea environments during the late Quaternary. The results show a major shift roughly 300 Kyr ago, across Marine Isotope Stages 9 and 8 (MIS 9/8), recorded in this study as mid-Brunhes transition at Hole 716A. The present study also combines published planktic foraminiferal fauna and pteropod records from Hole 716A to understand if the surface to shallow and intermediate water paleoenvironments were coupled with deep-water changes during the late Quaternary in the Maldivian Archipelago. Biofacies Robulus nicobarensis–Trifarina reussi (Rn–Tr), Uvigerina porrecta–Reussella simplex (Upo–Rs) and Cymbaloporetta squammosa–Bolivinita sp. (Cs–Bsp) dominate before the mid-Brunhes transition and document high organic flux with relatively low oxygen paleoenvironment, similar to the planktic foraminifer Globigerina bulloides population, while benthic foraminiferal biofacies Hoeglundina elegans–Miliolinella subrotunda (He–Ms) and Uvigerina peregrina–Quinqueloculina seminulum (Upe–Qs) record high seasonality in food supply with well-oxygenated deep water following the mid-Brunhes climatic transition (~ 300 Kyr ago at Hole 716A). These changes are also recorded in the population of planktic foraminiferal species Globigerinoides ruber and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei as well as pteropods. Organic carbon flux linked to changes in the IEW–EEC strength appears to be the most plausible factor controlling faunal assemblages and hence paleoproductivity dynamics in the Maldivian region. Our results suggest that the strength of the IEW is inversely related with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). The IOD strengthened across MIS 9/8 during which time the IEW weakened, leading to major changes at Hole 716A.

Factor and cluster analyses of 37 high ranking species of benthic foraminifera enabled us to identify four clusters representing four biofacies. Biofacies Sl-Om is characterised by Stilostomella lepidula, Orthomorphina modesta, Robulus gibbus, Bulimina miolaevis and Cibicides cf. lucidus. This biofacies dominates the latest Oligocene to early Miocene interval (24–21 Ma and 18.75–16.5 Ma), indicating low to intermediate dissolved oxygen, organic carbon rich environment, warm and sluggish deep waters. During 21–18.75 Ma, the biofacies Gp-Nu (Globocassidulina pacifica, Nuttallides umbonifera, Trifarina angulosa, Quinqueloculina weaveri, Robulus gibbus and Pullenia bulloides) dominates the benthic assemblage at Hole 756B. This biofacies also has a short lived presence at ~ 16.5 Ma. This was an interval of intense circulation of cold and corrosive deep water similar to Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), and intermediate to high flux of organic matter to Hole 756B. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) initiated during this time. From 16.5 to 10.6 Ma, the benthic assemblage at Hole 756B is dominated by biofacies Ub-Gs (characteristic species Uvigerina buzasi, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Laticarina pauperata), indicating intermediate to high food supply and cold deep water. This interval coincides with the middle Miocene positive oxygen isotope shift and permanent build up of Antarctic ice sheets. The late Miocene interval (10.6–6.5) is characterised by biofacies Ec-Bs (dominant species Ehrenbergina carinata, Bolivina spathulata, Osangularia culter and Pullenia osloensis) indicating low oxygen condition with high food supply in the study area. This corresponds to an interval of global biogenic bloom.	Deep-sea benthic foraminifera,Southeastern Indian Ocean,Antarctic Intermediate Water,Antarctic Circumpolar Current	2013-04-01 00:00:00

During summer or southwest monsoon season, intense upwelling zones driven by Ekman spiral appear in the western and eastern parts of the Arabian Sea that enhance surface primary production and thus proliferation of distinct fauna and flora. During the winter season, northeast monsoon winds cause deep convective overturning (mixing) that injects nutrients to the surface ocean and increases surface production. As a result, the primary production in the Arabian Sea has bimodal annual distribution. The present study analyses 5.6 Ma record of surface-dwelling planktic foraminifera, Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinoides ruber and Globigerinoides sacculifer from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 219, southeast Arabian Sea to understand changes in the surface ocean as driven by the Indian monsoon coinciding with the northern hemisphere glaciation (NHG). An increase in mixed-layer species at ~3.4 Ma suggests intense deep convective overturning caused by strong NE monsoon winds related to strengthening of NHG. G. bulloides shows a high positive relation with G. ruber during the past 3.4 Ma and a weak relation in the early Pliocene (5.6–3.4 Ma). The high G. bulloides percentages during the past 3.4 Ma could be linked to the injection of nutrients in the top layer by the advecting sub-surface nutrient-rich water	Deep convective mixing, NE monsoon, southeast Arabian Sea	2011-08-01 00:00:00

SCW was dominant before ~ 5.0 Ma, at ~ 3.6–2.4 Ma, and 1.2–0.8 Ma, whereas NCW dominated in the warm early Pliocene (5.0–3.6 Ma), and at 2.4–1.2 Ma. The relative volume of NCW and SCW fluctuated strongly over the last 0.8 Ma, with strong glacial–interglacial variability. The intensity of the Western Boundary Undercurrent was positively correlated to the relative volume of NCW. Values of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) were > 1.5% in sediments older than ~ 3.8 Ma, and not correlated to high primary productivity indicators, thus may reflect lateral transport of organic matter. TOC values decreased during the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG, 3.8–1.8 Ma). Benthic foraminiferal assemblages underwent major changes when the sites were dominantly under SCW (3.6–2.4 and 1.2–0.8 Ma), coeval with the ‘Last Global Extinction’ of elongate, cylindrical deep-sea benthic foraminifera, which has been linked to cooling, increased ventilation and changes in the efficiency of the biological pump. These benthic foraminiferal turnovers were neither directly associated with changes in dominant bottom water mass nor with changes in productivity, but occurred during global cooling and increased ventilation of deep waters associated with the intensification of the NHG.

Faunal data are combined with GEOSECS geochemical data to investigate any relationship between benthic foraminifera (assemblages and species) and deep-sea properties. In general, benthic foraminifera show a good correlation to surface productivity, organic carbon flux to the sea floor, deep-sea oxygenation and, to a lesser extent, to bottom temperature, without correlation with the water depths. The foraminiferal census data combined with geochemical data has enabled the division of the Indian Ocean into two faunal provinces. Province A occupies the northwestern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea region) where surface primary production has a major maximum during the summer monsoon season and a secondary maximum during winter monsoon season that leads to high organic flux to the seafloor, making the deep-sea one of the most oxygen-deficient regions in the world ocean, with a pronounced oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). This province is dominated by benthic foraminifera characteristic of low oxygen and high organic food flux including Uvigerina peregrina, Robulus nicobarensis, Bolivinita pseudopunctata, Bolivinita sp., Bulimina aculeata, Bulimina alazanensis, Ehrenbergina carinata and Cassidulina carinata. Province B covers southern, southeastern and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean and is dominated by Nuttallides umbonifera, Epistominella exigua, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Uvigerina proboscidea, Cibicides wuellerstorfi, Cassidulina laevigata, Pullenia bulloides, Pullenia osloensis, Pyrgo murrhina, Oridorsalis umbonatus, Gyroidinoides (= Gyroidina) soldanii and Gyroidinoides cf. gemma suggesting well-oxygenated, cold deep water with low (oligotrophic) and pulsed food supply.

Benthic foraminifera were analysed from >125 µm size fraction whereas Globigerina bulloides and pteropods were analysed from >150 µm size fraction. Factor analysis of most dominant benthic foraminiferal species over the studied time span made it possible to identify three biofacies characterizing distinct deep-sea environmental settings at Hole 716A. The environmental interpretation of each species is based on the ecology of recent deep-sea benthic foraminifera. The faunal record indicates fluctuating deep-sea conditions including changes in surface productivity, organic food supply and deep-sea oxygenation linked to changing wind intensities.

Destabilization of gas hydrates, frozen methane stored within the ocean floor sediment and in permafrost, may have provided an important source of methane to the atmosphere. Ocean Drilling Program Hole 997A (water depth 2770 m), situated on the crest of the Blake Outer Ridge, is a potentially large reservoir of gas hydrate. Methane emissions from the Blake Outer Ridge have been reported previously, which has been suggested as a driver for global climate change. Methane at this site is of biogenic origin, produced by the bacterial decomposition of organic matter. We used benthic foraminifer faunal assemblages (>125 µm size fraction) and species diversity, combined with total organic carbon data from Hole 997A, to identify intervals of methane releases during the late Neogene (last 5.4 Ma). We identified a group of benthic foraminifera, which were taken to indicate methane fluxes based on previous work on seep-related benthic foraminifera. We then classified ‘seep-related’ benthic foraminifera, as well as high organic carbon taxa independent of deep-sea oxygenation. We recognized five intervals of increased abundance of the seep-related benthic foraminifera since last 3.6 Ma representing intervals of methane release, which coincide with intervals of lowered sea level. Changes in benthic foraminifera are more abrupt over the past 3.6 Ma when the northern hemisphere glaciation began to intensify and climate switched to a 41-kyr cycle world.

Factor and cluster analyses enabled us to identify five biofacies defining five clusters. Known ecological preferences of benthic foraminifera were used for environmental interpretations. The faunal data documents a shift in deep-sea ventilation and productivity at 15-14 Ma, coinciding with the abrupt cooling in the middle Miocene.

We used factor and cluster analyses of census data of the 34 most dominant species of benthic foraminifera that enabled us to identify five biofacies: Astrononion umbilicatulum–Uvigerina proboscidea (Au–Up), Pullenia bulloides–Bulimina striata (Pb–Bs), Globocassidulina tumida–Nuttallides umbonifera (Gt–Nu), Gyroidinoides nitidula–Cibicides wuellerstorfi (Gn–Cw) and Cassidulina carinata–Cassidulina laevigata (Cc–Cl) biofacies. Knowledge of the environmental preferences of modern deep-sea benthic foraminifera helped to interpret the results of factor and cluster analyses in combination with oxygen and carbon isotope values. The biofacies indicative of high surface productivity, resulting from a stronger South Equatorial Current (Au–Up and Pb–Bs biofacies), dominate the early Pliocene interval (5.6–4.5 Ma) of global warmth. An intense Indo-Pacific ‘biogenic bloom’ and strong Oxygen Minimum Zone extended to intermediate depths (∼1000–2000 m) over large parts of the Indian Ocean in the early Pliocene. Since 4.5 Ma, the food supply in the Central Indian Ocean dropped and fluctuated while deep waters were corrosive (biofacies Gt–Nu, Gn–Cw). The Pleistocene interval is characterized by an intermediate flux of organic matter (Cc–Cl biofacies).

We employed knowledge of the ecology of recent deep-sea benthic foraminifera from different ocean basins for environmental interpretation of benthic assemblages. Benthic faunal data suggest that the interval 1200 – 1400 A.D. is marked by an increased influx of organic matter to the northwestern Arabian Sea floor that resulted from higher surface productivity during a stronger SW monsoon. This interval corresponds to the Medieval Warm Period and a wet phase in India. The organic flux was low during the Little Ice Age (1450-1850 A.D.) when the SW monsoon was weak. Over the last millennium, the SW monsoon was weakest during the Maunder Minimum, and since then it has shown a continuous intensification, coinciding with increased surface air temperatures.

Factor and cluster analyses of the 25 highest-ranked species made it possible to identify five biofacies, characterizing distinct deep-sea environmental settings. The environmental interpretation of each biofacies is based on the ecology of recent deep-sea benthic foraminifera. The benthic faunal record indicates fluctuating deep-sea conditions in environmental parameters including oxygenation, surface productivity and organic food supply. These changes appear to be linked to Indian summer monsoon variability, the main climatic feature of the Indian Ocean region. The benthic assemblages show a major shift at ∼ 0.7 to 0.6 Ma, marked by major turnovers in the relative abundances of species, coinciding with an increased amplitude of glacial cycles.

In the Holocene epoch, which had a more stable climate, the amplitude of abrupt changes in North Atlantic climate was much smaller, and it has been unclear whether these changes are related to monsoon variability. Here we present a continuous record of centennial-scale monsoon variability throughout the Holocene from rapidly accumulating and minimally bioturbated sediments in the anoxic Arabian Sea. Our monsoon proxy record reveals several intervals of weak summer monsoon that coincide with cold periods documented in the North Atlantic region4—including the most recent climate changes from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age and then to the present. We therefore suggest that the link between North Atlantic climate and the Asian monsoon is a persistent aspect of global climate	Holocene, Southwest monsoon, Marine sediments, Sudden variation, Climate variation, Asia, Arabian Sea, North Atlantic, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean	2003-02-01 00:00:00

Current science	Department of Biochemistry, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India	anilkgupta1954@gmail.com	The potential of enzyme inhibitors against infestation of insects serves as attractive strategy for the management of devastating pests. In an effort to identify some effective and eco-friendly inhibitors of a damaging pest, Helicoverpa armigera, iron and zinc were found to be potent inhibitors of H. armigera a-amylase, which is an important digestive enzyme required for its survival. This observation motivated us to determine the status of iron and zinc in different pigeon pea genotypes in response to H. armigera herbivory. In general, there was significant decline in zinc content in developing seeds and pod wall after herbivory. However, zinc content was significantly higher in moderately resistant genotypes than moderately susceptible genotypes in infested developing seeds. Significant accumulation of iron was also observed in developing seeds of moderately resistant and intermediate genotypes after the pod borer attack. Higher content of zinc in pod wall of moderately resistant genotypes could determine their resistibility status against H. armigera herbivory.

Therefore, the impediment of Helicoverpa armigera digestion can be the effective way of controlling this pest population. Nitrite was found to be a potent mixed non-competitive competitive inhibitor of partially purified α-amylase of H. armigera gut. This observation impelled us to determine the response of nitrite and nitrate reductase (NR) towards H. armigera infestation in nine pigeonpea genotypes (four moderately resistant, three intermediate and two moderately susceptible). The significant upregulation of NR in moderately resistant genotypes after pod borer infestation suggested NR as one of the factors that determine their resistance status against insect attack. The pod borer attack caused greater reduction of nitrate and significant accumulation of nitrite in moderately resistant genotypes. The activity of nitrite reductase (NiR) was also enhanced more in moderately resistant genotypes than moderately susceptible genotypes on account of H. armigera herbivory. Expression of resistance to H. armigera was further revealed when significant negative association between NR, NiR, nitrite and percent pod damage was observed. This is the first report that suggests nitrite to be a potent inhibitor of H. armigera α-amylase and also the involvement of nitrite and NR in providing resistance against H. armigera herbivory.

Alterations in their antioxidant pools — glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AsA) combined with activities of enzymes glutathione reductase (GR), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POX) and catalase (CAT) involved in defense against oxidative stress and stress parameters, namely chlorophyll (Chl), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were investigated in flag leaves from silk emergence till maturity. The drought caused transient increase in GR, APX, POX and CAT activities in drought-tolerant genotype (Parkash) which decreased at later stages with the extended period of drought stress. However, in Paras, drought stress caused decrease in activities of GR and CAT from initial period of stress till the end of experiment, except for POX which showed slight increase in activity. A significant increase in GSH content was observed in Parkash till 35 days after silking (DAS), whereas in Paras, GSH content remained lower than irrigated till maturity. Parkash which had higher AsA and Chl contents, also showed lower H2O2 and MDA levels than Paras under drought stress conditions. However, at the later stages, decline in antioxidant enzyme activities in Parkash due to severe drought stress led to enhanced membrane damage, as revealed by the accumulation of MDA. Our data indicated that significant activation of antioxidant system in Parkash might be responsible for its drought-tolerant behavior under drought stress and helped it to cope with the stress up to a definite period. Thus, the results indicate that antioxidant status and lipid peroxidation in flag leaves can be used as indices of drought tolerance in maize plants and also as potential biochemical targets for the crop improvement programmes to develop drought-tolerant cultivars.

Seed filling duration in wild species was about 15 days shorter than that of cultivated varieties due to rapid loss of moisture content and hence resulted in earlier maturity and reduced seed biomass. Longer seed filling duration appeared to be an important factor responsible for greater biomass of chickpea seeds. Because of absence of phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase from 25-35 days after flowering and low sucrose synthase activities, the podwall of C. judaicum is not in a position to contribute significantly to the sink filling capacity of seeds. High acid invertase, low sucrose synthase activities during seed storage phase cause detrimental effect on seed filling and resulting in highly reduced sink strength and productivity of wild species. Successful transfer of stress tolerance from wild Cicer species to chickpea cultivars need to prevent the transfer of these observed unfavourable biochemical factors so that the productivity of chickpea crop remains unaffected during utilization of wild Cicer species in chickpea improvement.

Activities of various antioxidative and anaerobic metabolism enzymes were investigated in leaf and root tissues. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in leaf tissue while glutathione reductase (GR) activity was enhanced in leaf as well as root in both the genotypes. However, tolerant genotype had better induction capability of SOD and GR in roots in comparison with sensitive genotype. Catalase activity increased in roots of both genotypes. Waterlogging caused strong induction in alcohol dehydrogenase activity in the roots of Paras and Parkash under stress conditions. Aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was significantly increased only in roots of Parkash in response to waterlogging. In comparison with sensitive genotype, the tolerant genotype had low H2O2 and malondialdehyde content in roots under stress conditions. The present studies suggested that tolerant genotype had a greater protective ability due to higher induced activities of antioxidant and ethanolic fermentation systems than Paras.

Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics	Department of Biochemistry, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, India	anilkgupta@satyam.net.in	In an effort to determine the biochemical markers for identifying genotypes before sowing for drought tolerance, changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes were determined in the seedlings of five drought-tolerant and five drought-sensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes, each with different genetic background growing under normal and water deficit conditions induced by 6% mannitol. In comparison with non-stressed seedlings, the catalase (CAT) activity was upregulated by more than 50% in the roots of water-stressed seedlings in drought-tolerant genotypes. Water deficit stress also led to the upregulation of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in the endosperms and glutathione reductase (GR), CAT and peroxidase (POD) in the shoots of stressed seedlings in drought-tolerant genotypes. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was very low in roots and shoots and showed non-significant increase under water-stress in tolerant genotypes. Out of five specified enzyme activities (CAT in roots and shoots, APX in endosperms, GR and POD in shoots), if any three are upregulated in the specified tissues under water deficit conditions, the genotype is likely to be drought-tolerant. Wheat seedlings with low GR and APX activities and high POD activity in shoots with a low ratio of GR activity of shoot to root of non-stressed seedlings are likely to perform better under rainfed conditions. The observed data showed that status of antioxidant enzymes could provide a meaningful tool for depicting drought tolerance of a wheat genotype.

During transition from anaerobic to aerobic respiration i.e. after 12 to 24 h of sowing, a sudden dip in the activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) was observed. The activities of CAT, GR and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were higher in shoots than roots while peroxidase (POX) activity was higher in roots. Alcohol- and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities in general were higher at pre-germination stages than post-germination from 48 to 96 hours. Presence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in endosperm during pregermination and post-germination stages indicated that pentose phosphate pathway is an integral pathway during oxygen deficit as well as aerobic metabolism.

Using cup method, a number of maize genotypes were screened on the basis of survival of the seedlings kept under waterlogging. Two tolerant (LM5 and Parkash) and three susceptible (PMH2, JH3459 and LM14) genotypes were selected for the present study. Activities of antioxidant and ethanolic fermentation enzymes and content of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glutathione and ascorbic acid were determined in roots of these genotypes after 72 h of waterlogging. Waterlogging treatment caused decline in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in all the genotypes. However, only susceptible genotypes showed slight increase in glutathione reductase (GR) activity. Significant reduction in APX/GR ratio in susceptible genotypes might be the cause of their susceptibility to waterlogging. The tolerant seedlings had higher GR activity than susceptible genotypes under unstressed conditions. Stress led to decrease in H2O2 and increase in glutathione content of both tolerant and susceptible genotypes, but only tolerant genotypes exhibited increase in ascorbic acid under waterlogging conditions. In the tolerant genotypes, all the enzymes of anaerobic metabolism viz. alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) were upregulated under waterlogging, whereas in susceptible genotypes, only ADH was upregulated, suggesting that efficient upregulation of entire anaerobic metabolic machinery is essential for providing tolerance against waterlogging.

Alterations in their antioxidant pools combined with activities of enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress were investigated in leaves. Activities of some reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzymes, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were enhanced in tolerant genotypes in response to drought stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was significantly decreased in sensitive genotypes, but remained unchanged in tolerant genotypes under stress. Peroxidase (POX) activity was significantly induced in tolerant, as well as sensitive genotypes. Imposition of stress led to increase in H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker for lipid peroxidation) content in sensitive genotypes, while in tolerant genotypes no change was observed. Significant increase in glutathione content was observed in sensitive genotypes. Ascorbic acid pool was induced in both tolerant and sensitive genotypes, but induction was more pronounced in tolerant genotypes. Significant activation of antioxidative defence mechanisms correlated with drought-induced oxidative stress tolerance was the characteristic of the drought tolerant genotypes.

Drought was maintained in pot raised plants by withholding irrigation at 95 days after sowing (DAS), i.e. just five days before the initiation of anthesis. Drought induced a significant reduction in mean biomass of all the internodes of sensitive cultivar as compared to those of tolerant one. Mobilized dry matter and mobilization efficiency were observed to be higher in the internodes of tolerant cultivar, both under control and stress conditions, which resulted in enhanced translocation of stem reserves to the grains. Water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), which mainly occur as fructans, were observed to be higher in the internodes of tolerant cultivar than those of sensitive one. When drought was applied, fructans were mobilized more effectively from the internodes of tolerant cultivar. A significantly higher sucrose synthase activity in the grains of tolerant cultivar, under drought conditions, increased the sink strength by unloading the assimilates in the sink, thereby increasing further mobilization of assimilates to the grains. Grains of sensitive cultivar attained maturity much earlier as compared to the tolerant one, both under control and stress conditions.

Delayed sowing associated with high temperature during grain filling resulted in an overall increase in total grain protein. Low temperature prevailing under early sown conditions enhanced insoluble glutenin (IG) but reduced total protein accumulation in both the genotypes. IG and residue proteins increased but soluble glutenin and amylose decreased under rain-fed conditions. Amylose, hold- and final viscosity (FV) increased but setback decreased with change in normal sowing time. Peak viscosity (PV) increased under late sown conditions. Pasting temperature, setback, FV and breakdown (BD) were enhanced under rain-fed conditions.

The sugar status of plant cells is sensed by sensor proteins. The signal generated by signal transduction cascades, which could involve mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein phosphatases, Ca2+ and calmodulins, results in appropriate gene expression. A variety of genes are either induced or repressed depending upon the status of soluble sugars. Abiotic stresses to plants result in major alterations in sugar status and hence affect the expression of various genes by down- and up-regulating their expression. Hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent pathways are involved in sugar sensing. Sucrose also acts as a signal molecule as it affects the activity of a proton-sucrose symporter. The sucrose transporter acts as a sucrose sensor and is involved in phloem loading. Fructokinase may represent an additional sensor that bypasses hexokinase phosphorylation especially when sucrose synthase is dominant. Mutants isolated on the basis of response of germination and seedling growth to sugars and reporter-based screening protocols are being used to study the response of altered sugar status on gene expression. Commoncis-acting elements in sugar signalling pathways have been identified. Transgenic plants with elevated levels of sugars/sugar alcohols like fructans, raffinose series oligosaccharides, trehalose and mannitol are tolerant to different stresses but have usually impaired growth. Efforts need to be made to have transgenic plants in which abiotic stress responsive genes are expressed only at the time of adverse environmental conditions instead of being constitutively synthesized.

Inulin is isolated from chicory roots by differential precipitation with ethanol (0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 per cent) from the aqueous extract of sun-dried roots, by melting the frozen chicory root extract and by removing the oligo-fructosachharides from chicory roots with 20 per cent ethanol. Different inulin preparations so obtained are compared with some of the commercial inulin preparations. Sun-dried roots are as good as the fresh roots for isolation of inulin but roots dried in an oven (80-90oC) have lower inulin content due to hydrolysis of fructans during drying. For better inulin yield, chicory roots should be extracted with water having pH adjusted to 7. pH of water on acidic side results in lower inulin recovery.

Post-stroke lower limb spasticity (PSLLS) impedes walking and quality of life (QOL). The understanding of the evidence of improved walking and QOL following botulinum toxin (BoNTA) injection is not clear. We performed a systematic review of the randomized control trials (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of BoNTA injection on walking and QOL in PSLLS. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, ProQuest Thesis and Dissertation checks, Google Scholar, WHO International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane, and ANZ and EU Clinical Trials Register for RCTs looking at improvement in walking and QOL following injection of BoNTA in PSLLS. The original search was carried out prior to 16 September 2015. We conducted an additional verifying search on CINHAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (via PubMed) from 16 September 2015 to 6 June 2017 using the same clauses as the previous search. Methodological quality of the individual studies was critically appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute’s instrument. Only placebo-controlled RCTs looking at improvement in walking and QOL were included in the review.Of 2026 records, we found 107 full-text records. Amongst them, we found five RCTs qualifying our criteria. No new trials were found from the verifying search. Two independent reviewers assessed methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using Joanna Briggs Institute’s appraisal instrument. Two studies reported significant improvement in gait velocity (p = 0.020) and < 0.05, respectively. One study showed significant improvement in 2-min-walking distance (p < 0.05). QOL was recorded in one study without any significant improvement. Meta-analysis of reviewed studies could not be performed because of different methods of assessing walking ability, small sample size with large confidence interval and issues such as lack of power calculations in some studies. Findings from our systematic and detailed study identify the need for a well-designed RCT to adequately investigate the issues highlighted. This review could not conclude there was sufficient evidence to support or refute improvement on walking or QOL following BoNTA injection. Reasons for this are discussed, and methods for future RCTs are developed.	Stroke, Spasticity, Botulinum toxin, Lower limb	2018-07-01 00:00:00

Five patients with functional decline were transferred from an acute care setting in a tertiary hospital to the rehabilitation unit. Full clinical evaluation and clinical reasoning were applied in addition to multidisciplinary care. Functional outcome and discharge destination were noted in each case. All patients had a new diagnosis that evolved during their stay in the rehabilitation unit in addition to their existing conditions. The new diagnosis helped to direct their future treatment programme. Four patients had good out-comes; they gained significant functional independence and were discharged home. One patient had an adverse outcome. In addition to multidisciplinary care, it is important to review the medical diagnosis in the rehabilitation unit. Diagnostic errors can have profound effect on the lives of patients with already existing impairments. Rehabilitation physicians should avoid making assumptions or diagnostic biases, and reapply clinical reasoning especially in the care of individuals with functional decline in rehabilitation.

Methods:In this retrospective review, 61 patients with SIJ pain (unilateral or bilateral) greater than six weeks duration were evaluated by pain history, clinical examination including SIJ provocative tests, laboratory investigations and skeletal imaging. Results:Fifty two patients (M: F, 31:21) were diagnosed to have specific SIJ pathologies amongst 61 patients presenting between 2002 to 2004. Forty patients (65%) were diagnosed with rheumatic conditions – ankylosing spondylitis (AS) – 21, undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (UspA) – 11, psoriatic arthropathy (PS) – 5, reactive arthropathy (ReA) – 1 and juvenile spondyloarthropathy (JS)-2. Non rheumatic conditions were involved in 12 patients (20%) – osteitis condensus ilii (OCI) – 4, osteomalacia – 2, tuberculosis – 2, pyogenic arthritis – 1, pregnancy related sacroiliac joint pain – 2 and malignancy in 1 patient. The diagnosis could not be confirmed in 9 patients (15%). Conclusions:Medical history, clinical examination including SIJ tests, plain radiography and laboratory investigations were helpful in diagnosing SIJ pathology in 39% cases (n = 24), 46% (n = 28) needed CT or MRI. A diagnostic scheme of dividing the SIJ pathologies into rheumatic and non-rheumatic conditions was helpful in evaluating patients with suspected SIJ pathologies.

Tactile sensing in both humans and robots can help to estimate surface properties like temperature, texture and hardness. These properties are important to perceive the environment as well as for object recognition and robotic manipulation of objects. In this paper, we focus on the classification of textures using a neuromorphic tactile sensor. The sensor uses a piezoresistive fabric sandwiched between conductive traces and encodes only changes in pressure intensity in the form of spike events. Textures are classified based on their geometry and the spatial frequencies. To do so, high-contrast tactile images are created by combining event data obtained across a palpation sequence and rotation-invariant features are used for classification using support vector machines (SVM). Our best results show average classification accuracy of 98% across different textures and palpation done in multiple directions. 	Support vector machines, Tactile sensors,Entropy,Neuromorphics	2018-12-01 00:00:00

Secondary metabolite pathways and genes involved in those pathways have been identified, and regulation of transcription and transcription factors has been determined by studying functional genomics in conjunction with data-mining tools of bioinformatics. Besides this, advances in metabolic engineering enable researchers to confer new secondary metabolic pathways to crops by transferring three to five, or more, heterologous genes taken from various other species. As an alternative, the metabolic pathways of useful secondary metabolites have been modified to improve their productivity via genetic transformation. However, there is a need to understand metabolic pathways of secondary metabolism at the molecular level. Plant hairy roots offer a novel and sustainable tissue-based system that preserves multiple specialized cell types believed to be important in maintaining a better consistency in synthesis of bioactive secondary molecules. This paper will review state-of-the-art reports on improving production of secondary metabolites in tissue cultures in various plant species.

Euphorbiaceae (Euphorbia antisyphilitica, E. tithymaloides, E. caducifolia, E. lathyris, E. neriifolia, Jatropha curcas, etc.), Asclepiadaceae (Calotropis gigantea and C. procera), Asteraceae, and Apocynaceae have a large number of valuable plants. These plants are able to grow well in arid and semiarid conditions of Rajasthan. We developed agrotechnology for some of these plants and suggested a three-tier system for optimum production of biomass. Influence of growth regulators, edaphic factors, cropping pattern, and nutritional factors have been optimized. The biofuel yield could be increased by employing technologies developed at University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. Production of high-quality plant material of Jatropha curcas was carried out at 35 ha Energy Plantation Demonstration Project Center, University of Rajasthan, under the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India project sanctioned to authors. The selected plant materials were characterized for their hydrocarbon and oil contents. High-yielding accessions of Jatropha curcas have been deposited at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi.

Urbanization is a global trend and is associated with increases in income, and higher urban incomes are correlated with higher consumption of energy and GHG emissions. This has resulted in increasing levels of greenhouse gases which absorb heat mainly infrared radiation, emitted from the Earth’s surface. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of these gases cause Earth to warm by trapping more of this heat. The CO2 level in 2012 was about 40% higher than it was in the nineteenth century. During Conference of the Parties (COP21), at Paris Climate Conference, (2015) a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change was achieved, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 °C. Substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions by mid-century through large-scale changes in energy systems and altered land use can be achieved. Biofuels, according to the IEA, could displace enough petroleum to avoid the equivalent of 2.1 Gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide emission each year if produced sustainably – about as much as net carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans. Currently, second-generation cellulosic biofuels and third-generation algal biodiesels are prominent biological approaches to sequester and convert CO2. The race is on to optimize the technology that can produce biofuels from lignocellulose sources, and it is expected that biotechnological advancement is expected to make this happen in the near future for the benefit of mankind.

Salinity stress is limiting agricultural crop productivity. One of the most serious forms of land degradation is secondary salinity/sodicity (i.e. Salinity developed due to saline water irrigation), which is prevalent in arid and semiarid regions of world. The production capacity of such lands is inhospitable because of their poor physical and chemical properties, altered ecosystem, and disturbed nutrient cycling resulted from land overuse and continual addition of chemicals. Such problems are now the major determinants of global crop productivity and consequently reclamation of such soil resources is the most urgent requirement for world food production and sustainable development.

The Kyoto Protocol shares the ultimate objective of the Convention to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of Green House Gases at a level that will prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. . Current biomass use, although not sustainable in some cases, replaces fossil fuel consumption and results in avoided CO2 emissions, representing about 2.7 to 8.8 % of 1998 anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The global biomass energy potential is large, estimated at about 104 EJ/a. hence, biomass has the potential to avoid significant fossil fuel consumption, potentially between 17 and 36 % of the current level and CO2 emissions potentially between 12 and 44 % of the 1998 level. There is significant scope then to integrate biomass energy with agriculture, forestry and climate change policies. Improved agronomic practices of well managed biomass plantations will also provide a basis for environmental improvement by helping to stabilize certain soils, avoiding desertification which is already occurring rapidly in tropical countries.

Biodiversity of a region can be utilized by human developmental activities provided re-plantation is done with the same pace. Gardens and horticulture has special role to create the message of interdependence of human being on natural resources. If we are utilizing natural resources without regeneration we are mining natural resources from finite means and ultimately human survival becomes impossible if natural resources are gone. There has to be an approach of sustainable development. During recent years housing schemes are taking into account the local habit and habitat of plants and making a selection of plant species and areas where minimal destruction of natural resources will take place. This is first step in sustainable development that we recharge water resources and replenish natural renewable resources also. Increased awareness of the public to environmental issues will lead to better biodiversity conservation along with conservation of natural resources. Besides creation of habitat for the local wildlife like small animals, birds, butterflies by using biological control measures instead of pesticides will help restore equilibrium between flora and fauna.

School of Biotechnology, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur 302004, Rajasthan, India	ashwanikumar214@gmail.com	Cardio Vascular diseases have assumed alarming proportions globally primarily due to life style changes, changing food habits and sedentary habits. Food plays an important role in regulating body functions and more so the cardio vascular functions. Obesity is a major cause of CVD and is related to nutrition and exercise. Excess fat in body gets deposited in adipose tissue, blood vessels, nerves and joints and often promotes diabetes, hypertension and renal disorders. All these can be regulated to a large extent by taking proper health supplements and regulating nutrition. Functional food rich in protein and fibers and less in calorific value can help in reducing reactive oxygen species and risks of myocardial infraction and improve quality of life. Nutraceuticals offer this possibility. Nutrition therapy focuses on maintaining optimal nutrition, modifying nutritional contents and controlling blood pressure. This paper reviews the role of nutraceuticals and dietary supplements from plant sources with special emphasis to medicinal herb fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) for enhancing good health and reducing risks of cardio vascular diseases.	nutraceuticals, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart disease, fenugreek	2014-05-01 00:00:00

This issue has not been previously explored in the Australian context. This study also seeks to identify factors that could inform health education and rehabilitation programs for migrant Asian Indians in Australia. The qualitative descriptive approach of constructivism was used for this study. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight patients and five family members. Participants were at risk for coronary heart disease either due to unhealthy diet and/or lack of physical exercise and irregular health checks. Although lifestyle modifications were implemented by participants after the cardiac event, these changes were implemented inconsistently and without continuity. Knowledge of the beneficial effects of a healthy diet did not deter the participants from continuing to follow unhealthy dietary habits. The introduction of any exercise or physical activity by participants in this study lacked consistency. A positive aspect revealed from this study was the influence of culture and religious faith, which helped patients and family members to cope with the illness trajectory. The results of this study suggest that health education and rehabilitation programs need to be designed specifically for this high-risk group would be beneficial when initiated early in life and need to be targeted to the individual.

Shin	Application-aware dynamic spectrum access	Wireless Networks	Real-Time Computing Laboratory, EECS Department, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA	ashwinik@eecs.umich.edu	Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) allows unlicensed wireless devices to opportunistically access unoccupied licensed spectrum bands. DSA yields efficient spectrum utilization which can greatly improve wireless networking performance. In this paper, we advocate application-awareness to effectively manage the side-effects of DSA that can offset its benefits by adversely impacting application QoS. Simple application hints are found to be able to serve as key inputs in evaluating current spectrum conditions relative to application needs, leading to an informed DSA mechanism that minimizes the impact of undesirable DSA side-effects. Towards this goal, we propose a wireless service architecture called Context-Aware Spectrum Agility (CASA). The key elements of CASA are: (a) semantic dependency equations that provide the relationship between application-layer QoS state and lower-layer DSA parameters, (b) CASA Algorithm that adapts DSA parameters and activities to better suit application needs, and, (c) a low overhead interface to provide application context to DSA. CASA has been explicitly designed with the goals of practical deployment, low overhead operation, and is compatible with any DSA protocol. Compared to state-of-art DSA, the deployment of CASA along with DSA protocols is shown to improve QoS metrics, such as delay and jitter, by an average of 30 and 64%, respectively. CASA is also found to match the application QoS demands for more than 90% of the duration of a communication session—a 300+% improvement over conventional application-agnostic DSA	Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Wireless networks, QoS, Software-Defined Radio (SDR), Cross-layer, Application hints	2012-04-01 00:00:00

Though DSA shows great potential to enhance spectrum efficiency, the associated constraints on QoS may limit its usefulness. QoS support in a DSA-based network is not trivial due to the fact that in addition to unfavorable characteristics of the wireless medium, the secondary devices are subject to additional interference and interruption from incumbents. In this paper, we present a case-study of key QoS provisioning techniques in DSA protocol design that facilitate the required application QoS. Specifically, we consider a CR system that supports high quality multimedia (including HDTV) streaming over UHF frequency bands. We model and evaluate the QoS- oriented CR system together with the underlying QoS-Provisioned DSA Protocol (referred as QPDP) through extensive simulations. The results show the effectiveness of DSA coupled with QoS provisioning, in supporting QoS-demanding consumer- oriented network applications in TV bands. This outcome is significant as FCC has recently approved UHF bands for unlicensed operations in the second Report and Order in the USA, and various DSA-based personal/portable CR systems are being actively considered by the consumer wireless industry.

Despite its advantages, the fundamental operations (e.g., periodic spectrum sensing) involved in realizing SA can also adversely affect application performance. We propose Context-Aware Spectrum Agility (CASA), which uses application hints together with the current channel condition to adapt key SA parameters. Our preliminary evaluation shows that CASA improves throughput by 35%, and is also more effective in meeting application demands than conventional SA.

There are many hosts used for the production of recombinant protein but the preferred choice is E. coli due to its easier culture, short life cycle, well-known genetics, and easy genetic manipulation. We often face a problem in the expression of foreign genes in E. coli. Soluble recombinant protein is a prerequisite for structural, functional and biochemical studies of a protein. Researchers often face problems producing soluble recombinant proteins for over-expression, mainly the expression and solubility of heterologous proteins. There is no universal strategy to solve these problems but there are a few methods that can improve the level of expression, non-expression, or less expression of the gene of interest in E. coli. This review addresses these issues properly. Five levels of strategies can be used to increase the expression and solubility of over-expressed protein; (1) changing the vector, (2) changing the host, (3) changing the culture parameters of the recombinant host strain, (4) co-expression of other genes and (5) changing the gene sequences, which may help increase expression and the proper folding of desired protein. Here we present the resources available for the expression of a gene in E. coli to get a substantial amount of good quality recombinant protein. The resources include different strains of E. coli, different E. coli expression vectors, different physical and chemical agents and the co expression of chaperone interacting proteins. Perhaps it would be the solutions to such problems that will finally lead to the maturity of the application of recombinant proteins. The proposed solutions to such problems will finally lead to the maturity of the application of recombinant proteins.	E. coli, Recombinant protein, expression, Vector, Host cell	2013-07-01 00:00:00

It affects the human body at multiple organ levels thus making it difficult to follow a particular line of the treatment protocol and requires a multimodal approach. The increasing medical burden on patients with diabetes-related complications results in an enormous economic burden, which could severely impair global economic growth in the near future. This shows that today’s healthcare system has conventionally been poorly equipped towards confronting the mounting impact of diabetes on a global scale and demands an urgent need for newer and better options. The overall challenge of this field of diabetes treatment is to identify the individualized factors that can lead to improved glycaemic control. Plants are traditionally used worldwide as remedies for diabetes healing. They synthesize a diverse array of biologically active compounds having antidiabetic properties. This review is an endeavour to document the present armamentarium of antidiabetic herbal drug discovery and developments, highlighting mechanism-based antidiabetic properties of over 300 different phytoconstituents of various chemical categories from about 100 different plants modulating different metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, glycogen synthesis and degradation, cholesterol synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism as well as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor activation, dipeptidyl peptidase inhibition and free radical scavenging action. The aim is to provide a rich reservoir of pharmacologically established antidiabetic phytoconstituents with specific references to the novel, cost-effective interventions, which might be of relevance to other low-income and middle-income countries of the world.	antidiabetics, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, metabolism, phytoconstituents	2018-02-01 00:00:00

Increased oxidative stress is an important cause and result of diabetes and it is thought to underlie the cellular changes that lead to diabetic complications. The whole cause and effect form a vicious circle, underlying many layers of potential therapeutics in its research. In this regards, this review outlines the briefs about the correlation of type 2 diabetes and oxidative (or nitrosative) stress and also compiles the potentiality of various antioxidants that are being or can be used for alleviating the oxidative stress. Since the complications are like a knit matrix of numerous deteriorating mechanisms, a single antioxidant therapeutic approach cannot be an answer. Therefore, it is important to develop new fixed-dose combinations of effective antioxidants that target key reactive oxygen (or nitrogen)-producing sources, mimic endogenous antioxidants and scavenge the reactive species generated balancing the pro and antioxidant cycle. This review focuses on the preclinical and clinical trial data with therapeutic antioxidants in type 2 diabetes along with a brief focus on success and failures of antioxidant-based therapy.

Pacing advent of new resistance mechanisms in this microorganism exists, rendering treatment of infectious disease difficult. Ciprofloxacin is no longer considered the first choice of antimicrobial agent due to the emergence of resistance. Therefore, the need for scenario is to find out novel drug target and its potential inhibitor to fight against this pathogen. The present study was undertaken to find out a novel drug target and its inhibitor for improving the current therapeutic methods for treating Salmonella infections. It is found that l-asparaginase is exploited by the pathogen for its survival benefit. Therefore, it could be targeted to fight against lethality caused by Salmonella infections. In the present in silico study, the 3-D structure of the enzyme l-asparaginase was modelled by using homology modeling technique. Thereafter, molecular docking studies and ADMET prediction to assess pharmacokinetic profiles of test ligands (eugenol and its derivative) was performed. The results show that eugenol and its derivative are capable of inhibiting the Salmonella virulent protein l-asparaginase. There were 18 ligands including ciprofloxacin (used as reference) were docked. The lowest binding energy was observed with eugenol derivative 8 i.e -5.836 kcal/mol while for ciprofloxacin was -4.661 kcal/mol. The docking of the eugenol derivative 8 with l-asparaginase revealed a strong interaction between them with two hydrogen bonds. Thr 35 and Asp 116 residues are actively participating in this interaction. The result of ADMET profiling suggests the potency of eugenol and its derivatives against Salmonellal-asparaginase-II as a compelling drug candidate. These findings provide useful information on the biological role, structure-based drug design and potent inhibitor of l-asparaginase for the development of effective therapeutic molecule against Salmonella infection.

Pharmacological reports: PR	Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Raipur 492010, India	drawanishkr@gmail.com; awanik.bt@nitrr.ac.in	Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most devastating type caused by Leishmania donovani, Leishmania infantum, and Leishmania chagasi. The therapeutic mainstay is still based on the antiquated pentavalent antimonial against which resistance is now increasing. Unfortunately, due to the digenetic life cycle of parasite, there is significant antigenic diversity. There is an urgent need to develop novel drug/vaccine targets against VL for which the primary goal should be to identify and characterize the structural and functional proteins. Proteomics, being widely employed in the study of Leishmania seems to be a suitable strategy as the availability of annotated sequenced genome of Leishmania major has opened the door for dissection of both protein expression/regulation and function. Advances in clinical proteomic technologies have enable to enhance our mechanistic understanding of virulence/pathogenicity/host–pathogen interactions, drug resistance thereby defining novel therapeutic/vaccine targets. Expression proteomics exploits the differential expression of leishmanial proteins as biomarkers for application towards early diagnosis. Further using immunoproteomics efforts were also focused on evaluating responses to define parasite T‐cell epitopes as vaccine/diagnostic targets. This review has highlighted some of the relevant developments in the rapidly emerging field of leishmanial proteomics and focus on its future applications in drug and vaccine discovery against VL.

In this study, we have investigated the production of “Lacto-pickle” using a plant Elephant Foot Yam (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius; Cultivar: IGAM-1) in presence of Lactobacillus plantarum (MTCC-1325). Response Surface Methodology was used to evaluate the effects of three optimum variables, i.e., salt concentration (8%, w/v), inoculum volume (10%, v/v), and incubation period (22 days) on lactic acid (LA; a natural preservative) production, using a full factorial Central Composite Design. Under optimized conditions, the predicted response for “LA production” (3.992 g/kg) were found very close to the experimental response (3.873 g/kg) providing the validity of the model. The treatment with 8–10% brine solution during LA fermentation was found to be the most acceptable organoleptically. EFY Lacto-pickle with 8 and 10% (w/v) brine solutions had a proximate composition of starch, 55–68 g/kg; total sugar, 1.3–1.6 g/kg; crude protein, 37.9–38.5 g/kg; and fat, 22.5–23.0 g/kg on fresh weight basis. The viability of the strains was determined during long-term storage (6 weeks) of EFY Lacto-pickle at room-temperature and viable cell counts were remain constant. The antagonistic activity of viable cells against food-borne pathogenic microorganism was also determined and shown to process inhibitory activities towards pathogens.

Both genetic and environmental factors (infections, stress, diet) are involved in the development of IBD. As we know that bacteria are found in the intestinal mucosa of human and clinical observations revealed bacterial biofilms associated with patients of IBD. Various factors and microbes are found to play an essential role in biofilm formation and mucosal colonization during IBD. Biofilm formation in the digestive tract is dependent on an extracellular matrix synthesized by the bacteria and it has an adverse effect on the immune response of the host. There is no satisfactory and safe treatment option for IBD. Therefore, the current research aims to disrupt biofilm in IBD and concentrates predominantly on improving the drug. Here, we review the literature on bacterial biofilm and IBD to gather new knowledge on the current understanding of biofilm formation in IBD, host immune deregulation and dysbiosis in IBD, molecular mechanism, bacteria involved in biofilm formation, current and future regimen. It is urgently required to plan new ways to control and eradicate bacteria in biofilms that will open up novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for IBD.

Therefore, measurement of SUA levels could play a valuable role as predictor marker in early type 2 diabetics as well as a potent antioxidant therapeutic. This work is a small demographic study in the patients of Chhattisgarh to find a relation between the SUA level and diabetes parameters in diabetics and controls. Materials and Methods: This was a small sample set case–control study. Patients were divided into two groups, namely, control (n = 25) and type 2 diabetics (n = 30). Biochemical estimation of parameters was performed using commercially available enzymatic kits. Results: Plasma glucose, serum triglyceride, glycated haemoglobin and creatinine were higher in diabetic patients than in controls. SUA showed a significant lower level in test patients (2.97 ± 0.22) as compared to control (4.35 ± 0.64). A negative correlation of r = −0.8159 was obtained between SUA and plasma glucose levels. Conclusions: Results suggest that variation in uric acid (UA) levels from normal to pre-diabetes and diabetes condition could be an important biomarker. Further validations may pave the way for UA measurement as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in type 2 diabetes mellitus.	Biomarker, serum, type 2 diabetes mellitus, uric acid	2017-09-01 00:00:00

The relevance of this enzyme is not only limited as an anti-cancer agent, it also possesses a wide range of medical application. The application includes the antimicrobial property, treatment of infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, canine and feline cancer. Apart from the health care industry, its significance is also established in the food sector as a food processing agent to reduce the acrylamide concentration. L-asparaginase is known to be produced from various bacterial, fungal and plant sources. However, there is a huge market demand due to its wide range of application. Therefore, the industry is still in the search of better-producing source in terms of high yield and low immunogenicity. It can be produced by both submerged and solid state fermentation, and each fermentation process has its own merits and demerits. This review paper focuses on its improved production strategy by adopting statistical experimental optimization techniques, development of recombinant strains, through mutagenesis and nanoparticle immobilization, adopting advanced and cost-effective purification techniques. Available research literature proves the competence and therapeutic potential of this enzyme. Therefore, research orientation toward the exploration of this clinical significant enzyme has to be accelerated.

There are both medical and surgical therapies to treat venous leg ulcers; however, a cure does not yet exist. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable and proved of accelerating wound healing in vivo and their study with human chronic wounds is currently awaited. MSCs are a promising source of adult progenitor cells for cellular therapy and have been demonstrated to differentiate into various mesenchymal cell lineages. They have a crucial and integral role in native wound healing by regulating immune response and inflammation. Improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms at work in delayed wound healing compels to the development of cellular therapy in VLU. This review focuses on the current treatment option of VLU and further emphasizing the role of MSCs in accelerating the healing process. With further understanding of the mechanism of action of these cells in wound improvement and, the involvement of cytokines can also be revealed that could be used for the therapeutic purpose for VLU healing.

This serves the basis to explore better producer microbial strains to bridge the gap between huge demand and supply of this therapeutic enzyme. The present study deals with the successful screening of potent microorganisms producing l-asparaginase. 47 microorganisms were screened including bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Among all, Penicillium lilacinum showed the highest enzyme activity i.e., 39.67 IU/ml. Shigella flexneri has 23.21 IU/ml of enzyme activity (highest among all the bacterial strain tested). Further, the 3-D structure of l-asparaginase from higher producer strains was developed and validated in silico for its activity. l-asparagine (substrate for l-asparaginase) was docked inside the binding pocket of P. lilacinum and S. flexneri. Docking score for the most common substrate l-asparagine is −6.188 (P. lilacinum), −5.576 (S. flexneri) which is quite good. Moreover, the chemical property of the binding pocket revealed that amino acid residues Phe 243, Gln 260, Gly 365, Asp 386 in P. lilacinum and residues Asp 181, Thr 318, Asn 320 in S. flexneri have an important role in H-bonding.

The drugs administered through the oral route encounter the process of hepatic first pass metabolism. Among the alternative delivery routes, mucosal route is being investigated as the most preferred route. Different mucosal routes include the gastrointestinal tract (oral), vagina, buccal cavity and nasal cavity. Novel formulations are being developed using natural and synthetic polymers that could increase the residence time of the drug at mucosal surface in order to facilitate permeation and reduce (or bypass) the first pass metabolism. For recombinant drugs, the formulations are accompanied by enzyme inhibitors and penetration enhancers. Buccal cavity (buccal and sublingual mucosa) has smaller surface area than the gastrointestinal tract but the drugs can easily escape the first pass metabolism. Chitosan is the most applied natural polymer while synthetic polymers include Carbopol and Eudragit. Chitosan has inherent properties of mucoadhesion and penetration enhancement apart from biodegradability and efflux pump inhibition. This review hoards the important research purview of chitosan as a compatible drug carrier macromolecule for mucosal delivery on single platform.

It has been validated as an important therapeutic target in Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes. Few molecules targeting GSK-3 are currently in clinical trials. In this study, we have compared certain docking and computational ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) parameters of a few GSK-3 targeted ligands (Indirubin, Hymenialdisine, Meridianins, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime) against two control molecules (Tideglusib and LY-2090314) to derive and analyze the basic drug-like properties of the test compounds. Docking between the GSK-3 and various ligands was done using AutoDock while ADME parameters were derived from ADMET server PreADMET and admetSAR. Various docked images were retrieved from docking, indicating the docking sites in the target protein. Out of four compounds tested, 6-bromoindirubin-3-oxime (6-BIO) was found as the best docking and ADME parameters, followed by Hymenialdisine (HMD). The LigPlot interaction results show two residues Leu (188) and Thr (138) to be common at the interaction site. The LD50 of 6-BIO is better than one of the control ligands while very similar to the other. Some of the parameters were very similar to the control ligands, thus, making it a suitable candidate among the test ligands. From this in-silico study, we concluded that 6-BIO is a potent drug candidate which could be further tested in vitro and in vivo to establish a drug molecule. Since, 6-BIO is a chemically modified form of the basic molecule Indirubin, we can hypothesize that certain other modified indirubins could be tested as GSK-3 targeted ligands.

But it is getting polluted due to high industrial growth. The heavy metals produced by industrial activities are recurrently added to it and considered as dangerous pollutants. Increasing concentration of toxic heavy metals (Pb2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Ni2+) in water is a severe threat for human. Heavy metal contaminated water is highly carcinogenic and poisonous at even relatively low concentrations. When they discharged in water bodies, they dissolve in the water and are distributed in the food chain. Bacteria and fungi are efficient microbes that frequently transform heavy metals and remove toxicity. The application of bacteria and fungi may offer cost benefit in water treatment plants for heavy metal transformation and directly related to public health and environmental safety issues. The heavy metals transformation rate in water is also dependent on the enzymatic capability of microorganisms. By transforming toxic heavy metals microbes sustain aquatic and terrestrial life. Therefore the application of microbiological biomass for heavy metal transformation and removal from aquatic ecosystem is highly significant and striking. This paper reviews the microbial transformation of heavy metal, microbe metal interaction and different approaches for microbial heavy metal remediation from water bodies.

The 42 amino acid (Aβ1–42) is the predominant form of peptide found in the neuritic plaques and has been demonstrated to be neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro. The availability of large quantities of Aβ peptide will help in several biochemical and biophysical studies that may help in exploring the aggregation mechanism and toxicity of Aβ peptide. We report a convenient and economical method to obtain such a peptide biologically. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding Aβ1–42 were constructed and amplified through the polymerase cycling assembly (also known as assembly PCR), followed by the amplification PCR. Aβ1–42 gene was cloned into pET41a(+) vector for expression. Interestingly, the addition of 3% (v/v) ethanol to the culture medium resulted in the production of large amounts of soluble Aβ fusion protein. The Aβ fusion protein was subjected to a Ni–NTA affinity chromatography followed by enterokinase digestion, and the Aβ peptide was purified using glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography. The peptide yield was ∼15 mg/L culture, indicating the utility of this method for high-yield production of soluble Aβ peptide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and immunoblotting with anti-His antibody confirmed the identity of purified Aβ fusion protein and Aβ peptide. In addition, this method provides an advantage over the chemical synthesis and other conventional methods used for large-scale production of recombinant Aβ peptide.

FOSs was produced from Aspergillus oryzae (MTCC5154) while IMOs and standards of 1-kestose, 1-nystose, 1-fructofuranosyl nystose and panose were procured. In silico docking studies were performed by GLIDE program for each of the FOSs and IMOs for PPAR-γ activation and DPP-IV inhibition. Diabetic rats treated with FOS + IMO showed relatively more amelioration of glycemic and lipid dysmetabolism, remarkable reduction in oxidative markers, increased GLP-1 content as well as Bifidobacteria/Lactobacilli population in caecum than lone FOSs/IMOs treatment. Out of nine oligosaccharides docked from FOS and IMO; panose, nystose and kestose showed highest ranking binding mode with DPP-IV and PPAR-γ and were selected for in vitro study either alone or in combinations. On its own nystose showed potent DPP-IV inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 146.8 μM while panose at 20.2 μM concentrations showed 50% binding ability to PPAR-γ-LBD. Combinations of oligosaccharides tested namely Nys + Pan, Nys + Kes and Pan + Kes demonstrated significant (p < 0.001) effect on PPAR-γ/DPP-IV bioassay.

Through advanced image analysis techniques are used for abnormalities detection in retina that define and correlate the severity of DR. A thorough study is done in this area in recent past years and on the basis of these studies we have developed a computer based prediction model that is used to determine the severity of DR. To identify severity DR, we have analyzed the human eye image. We have extracted some important features from human eye image i.e. Blood Artery, Optical disc, Exudates. Based on these image and data we have designed an automated system for the determination of DR severity. This automated DR severity assessment methods can be used to predict the clinical case and conditions when young clinicians would agree or disagree with their more experienced fellow members. The algorithms described in this study may be used in clinical practice to validate or invalidate the diagnoses. Algorithms or method developed here may also be used for pooling diagnostic knowledge for serving mankind. Here we have described a computational based low cost retinal diagnostic approach which can aid an ophthalmologist to quickly diagnose the various stages of DR. This system can accept retinal images and can successfully detect any pathological condition associated with DR.

WHO has predicted the number of diabetics to be approximately 366 millions by 2030. The disease is characterized by hyperglycemia and the basic symptoms are polyphagia, polydipsia and polyuria. The autoimmune type 1 diabetes represent almost 1% of the total diabetic population, the rest being that of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Type 2 diabetes has been linked to a variety of factors such as heredity, environmental factors, unhealthy eating habits, sedentary lifestyle, stress etc. The uncontrolled hyperglycemia has profound deleterious effects on almost all the organs and results in various cardiovascular disorders, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Recent studies have revealed an array of pulmonary dysfunctions related with T2D ranging from respiratory defects to tuberculosis. Diabetes also predisposes the person to hepatic dysfunctions like NAFLD and HCC and a range of infections at various sites which are difficult to manage. Post-surgical infections are of special interest for subjects with uncontrolled hyperglycemia prior to surgery.

It exhibits a characteristic peptide bond between the α-carboxyl groups and ɛ-amino groups of 25–35 l-lysine residues. It has a wide antimicrobial spectrum. Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi do not easily develop resistance to it. ɛ-PL is polycationic in nature; therefore, it interferes with their cell membranes by ionic adsorption, leading to physiological damage to the microbial cell. ɛ-PL producers commonly possess a membrane-bound ɛ-PL-degrading aminopeptidase, which has high enzyme activity at pH above 4.0 and may play a role in self-protection. Because ɛ-PL is safe for human consumption and is biodegradable, therefore it has been used in many novel applications in the fields of food, medicine, environment, agriculture, and electronics in past decades.

Treatments for VL are unsatisfactory till date and alarming rise of drug resistance is a serious problem. Vaccines to control VL have shown some promise, but none are in current clinical use. Therefore, urgent needs for new and effective anti-leishmanials are prerequisite. To identify the potential factors, DNA microarray an advance, high throughput technology, has open the possibility of discovering new genes that can contribute to vaccine initiatives or serve as potential drug targets. It has been successfully applied to many of the protozoan parasites and identified some new genes as targets. Target discovery is the key step in the biomarker and drug discovery pipeline to diagnose. After the completion of genome sequencing of Leishmania major and L. infantum, advancement in microarray technologies provide new approaches to study the pattern of gene expression profile during differentiation and development of parasite. It has the potential to improve our understanding of pathogenicity, mechanism of drug resistance and virulence factors by identifying up/down regulated gene and characterizing the respective gene expression. Keeping these backgrounds in mind, we reviewed the data obtained from genome-wide wide expression profiling in Leishmania that focuses on applications of microarray in novel vaccine/drug targets discovery for VL and discuss the potential avenues for their future investigation. Ultimately this will be able to translate the findings into the development of novel therapeutic approaches and targets for VL.

The effects of the degree of deacetylation (DDA) and the molecular weight (Mw) of chitin on the properties of SAP were investigated in detail. With increasing the DDA and Mw, the yield improved while the water absorbency decreased, yet the effect of DDA is insignificant if the Mw is smaller enough. The structures were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TG, DSC, XPS, solid-state 13C NMR and elemental analyses. The results indicated that the poly(acrylic acid) chains were successfully grafted onto the chitin backbones, and the reaction sites were the NH2 on the chitosan units. The possible mechanism was further discussed, which was similar to that suggested for chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) SAP.

Edible gliadin nanoparticles (GNPs) were fabricated using the anti-solvent method. They possessed unique high foamability and foam stability. An increasing concentration of GNPs accelerated their initial adsorption speed from the bulk phase to the interface and raised the viscoelastic modulus of interfacial films. High foamability (174.2 ± 6.4%) was achieved at the very low concentration of GNPs (1 mg/mL), which was much better than that of ovalbumin and sodium caseinate. Three stages of adsorption kinetics at the air/water interface were characterized. First, they quickly diffused and adsorbed at the interface, resulting in a fast increase of the surface pressure. Then, nanoparticles started to fuse into a film, and finally, the smooth film became a firm and rigid layer to protect bubbles against coalescence and disproportionation. These results explained that GNPs had good foamability and high foam stability simultaneously.

The sizes and surface wettability of particles were further regulated by using a polysaccharide. The sizes of nanocomplexes ranged from 205.8 to 422.2 nm and increased with the addition of polysaccharide. Their contact angles decreased from 84.1° to 59.3°, revealing their hydrophilic nature. Results of fluorescence microscopy and cryo-scanning electron microscopy indicated that nanocomplexes were located at the oil–water interface. Interfacial shear and dilatational rheological data revealed a fast and irreversible adsorption behavior, which differed from rearrangement of gelatin molecules at the oil–water interface. The minimal concentration of nanocomplexes required to stabilize emulsions was 0.1 wt %.

The formulated CS-LDL NPs were then applied to encapsulate doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) with the encapsulation efficiency of 51.7%. The average particle size and ζ-potential of DOX-loaded CS-LDL NPs (CS-LDL-DOX NPs) were 179 nm and +48.3 mV, respectively. The encapsulated DOX showed less cytotoxicity than free DOX after 24-h incubation with gastric cancer SGC7901 cells, which may be due to extended release. Cellular uptake of CS-LDL-DOX NPs was significant higher than that of free DOX due to the endocytosis of tumor cells. Thus CS-LDL-DOX NPs showed a potential in reducing cytotoxicity of DOX by extended release behavior and preferential uptake compared to free DOX. In addition, flow cytometry and terminal-deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay demonstrated that CS-LDL-DOX NPs induced the apoptosis of cancer cells.

While for superoxide-scavenging and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, the outmost component affected the scavenging capacity of nanofibrous mats. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were combined to characterize the morphology and structure of the deposited mineral phase on the scaffolds after culturing in a simulated body fluid (SBF) for 5 days.

The two biopolymers transited from co-solubility state to form soluble complexes, and finally produced tenuous network as the pH further decreased. The fluorescent images indicated that the network was cross-linked of XG chains by Ly, liking a polymerization process which resulted in the sol-gel transition by electrostatic interactions. High Ly content could accelerate the phase transition at the same pH condition, while XG played a contrary role. XG addition could enhance the thermal stability of Ly. The phase transition was also illustrated by ζ-potential at different pHs. The boundary parameters were determined to distinguish the phase transition regions. At the pH higher than pHφ, the negatively liked XG and Ly were in co-soluble state. They formed soluble complexes at the pH between pHφ and pHg, and gel was obtained with net microstructure as the pH continuously decreased (lower than pHg). The paper provides practical parameters that may be applicable in controlling the structure, texture, and stability of polysaccharide/protein system, as well as in food and medicinal application with various purposes.

Herein, chitin microspheres with average diameter of 80 μm fabricated via a new way were found to load anthocyanins with predicted capacity based on Langmuir isotherm as much as 2718 ± 54 mg/g under the optimal condition of pH 4, which is the largest amount ever reported. Electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were proved to be the main driving forces for the load of anthocyanins by chitin microspheres. Moreover, less than 30% of the loaded anthocyanins ± were released under the investigated pH range from 1.2 to 6 because of the strong interaction between chitin microspheres and anthocyanins. Finally, it was found about 40% of the loaded anthocyanins was released in the simulated gastrointestinal tract for chitin microspheres. Moreover, after coating the anthocyanins loaded chitin microspheres with a layer of ethyl cellulose, more than 85% loaded anthocyanins were delivered to the colon. All the results revealed that new chitin microspheres were promising carriers for colon specific delivery of bioactive compounds. This work demonstrated an effective new way to utilize original chitin, which is abundant but less researched in the field of food science.

Oil-in-water Pickering emulsion stabilized by chitosan-tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) nanoparticles and nanoemulsions containing an organic phase (Span80:Tween80), were prepared with either medium chain triglyceride (MCT) or corn oil as long chain triglyceride (LCT). An in vitro gastrointestinal (GIT) model consisting of mouth, gastric and intestinal phases was used to characterize the rate and extent of lipid phase digestion of the ingested samples. A centrifugation method determined fraction of curcumin released into mixed micelles after digestion (bioaccessibility). These findings showed that after subjecting to simulated GIT model, all the emulsion systems experienced a progressive increase in mean particle size, due to droplet flocculation and coalescence after digestion. Electrical charge (ζ) of particles was observed to become highly negative as they passed through GIT due to accumulation of anionic bile salts, phospholipids and free fatty acids at their interfaces. The rate and extent of lipid digestion and bioaccessibility of curcumin increased with decreasing mean droplet diameter (NMCT > NCO > PMCT > PCO). Finally, we showed that as compared to free curcumin, the encapsulated curcumin showed higher radical scavenging activity (RSA), which confirmed the protective effect of the emulsion systems on the antioxidant activity of curcumin	Nano and Pickering emulsions,Curcumin encapsulation,Digestion,Bioaccessibility,Antioxidant activity	2016-08-01 00:00:00

The prepared magnetic carbon aerogels (Mag-CA) materials were characterized by various methods, including BET surface area analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). What⿿s more, the Mag-CA materials were used as adsorbents to remove dyes [anionic methyl orange (MO) and cationic methylene blue (MB)] from aqueous solutions. The results showed that Mag-CA had an excellent adsorption performance towards MO and MB. The adsorption equilibrium data of both MO and MB can be well described by Langmuir model. The maximum MO and MB uptake capacity of Mag-CA reached 7.42 mg g⿿1 and 9.37 mg g⿿1 according to Langmuir isotherm at 303 K, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters such as οG, οH and οS were estimated to understand the adsorption mechanism of MO and MB.

It has been quantitatively analyzed by GPC-MALLS. After reaching phase equilibrium, GA with the small molecular weight migrated into KGM-rich phase, resulting in a decrease of its relative content (from 13.58% to 0.05%) in GA-rich phase. GA was dyed with fluorochrome, and aggregations of GA in separated phase were recorded using fluorescence microscopy. When KGM content was fixed at 0.4 wt%, increasing GA concentration led to the simultaneous formation of larger aggregates of GA. In the process of phase separation, the amount of coexisted KGM in GA-rich phase decreased as a function of time. To collect the separated phases, the fractionated GA was named as FGA. FGA showed better interfacial properties than original GA, resulting in decreasing of oil-water interfacial tension and increasing of the moduli of interfacial adsorption layer. The proposed reason was that fractions of GA maintained in GA-rich phase, which has proved to possess larger molecular weight, contributed to the better emulsifying capacity. So FGA was the concentrated sample of large molecular fractions that has high emulsifying capacity. Optimized FGA-stabilized emulsions presented small droplet size (around 20 μm), high surface charge at neutral pH (about −30 mV) and high stabilities under various pH range or NaCl concentration. Taken together, this paper provides a flexible method for separating and concentrating GA with high emulsifying capability and has great potentials to be applied in in developing new food ingredients	Molecular migration,Phase separation,Konjac glucomannan,Gum Arabic,Interfacial properties,Emulsion stabilities	2016-07-01 00:00:00

However, the poor kinetic reversibility and electrochemical activity of the redox reaction of I3 −/I− couples on graphite felts (GFs) electrode can result in low energy efficiency. Two nanoporous metal−organic frameworks (MOFs), MIL-125- NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, that have high surface areas when introduced to GF surfaces accelerated the I3 −/I− redox reaction. The flow cell with MOF-modified GFs serving as a positive electrode showed higher energy efficiency than the pristine GFs; increases of about 6.4% and 2.7% occurred at the current density of 30 mA/cm2 for MIL-125-NH2 and UiO-66-CH3, respectively. Moreover, UiO-66-CH3 is more promising due to its excellent chemical stability in the weakly acidic electrolyte. This letter highlights a way for MOFs to be used in the field of RFBs.

Polyphenolic drug-loaded films can be coated on various devices with different shapes and sizes. Here, we report a novel versatile pH-responsive system based on hydrogen-bonded poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)/tannin acid (TA) coatings on zein/TA colloidal nanoparticles (zein/TA/PEG NPs). Hydrogen bonding was considered to be the driving force for the coating buildup between PEG and TA, which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. Because of the reversible/dynamic nature of hydrogen bonding, the release profile of TA was directed by pH value, temperature, ionic strength and TA concentration. The release rate of TA increased with increasing pH and temperature, but decreased with increasing ionic strength. This new drug delivery vehicle could also be used to load hydrophobic and unstable molecules through interacting with zein by hydrophobic interaction to achieve efficient protection. We demonstrated that the hydrophobic molecular nutrient, VD3, can be successfully loaded into zein/TA/PEG NPs with high encapsulation efficiency. Photostability against UV light was significantly improved after encapsulation.

It was found that the subunits and secondary structure of OVA did not change significantly with HIUS treatment from the electrophoretic patterns and circular dichroism (CD) spectrum. The amount of free sulfhydryl groups increased and intrinsic fluorescence spectra analysis indicated changes in the tertiary structure and partial unfold of OVA after sonication increased. Compared with the untreated OVA, HIUS treatment increased the emulsifying activity and foaming ability, and decreased interface tension (oil–water and air–water interface), which due to the increased surface hydrophobicity and decreased the surface net charge in OVA, while the emulsifying and foaming stability had no remarkable differences. The increased particle size may be attributed to formation of protein aggregates. Moreover, the gelation temperatures of HIUS-treated samples were higher than the untreated OVA according to the temperature sweep model rheology, and this effect was consistent with the increased in surface hydrophobicity for ultrasound treated OVA. These changes in functional properties of OVA would promote its application in food industry.

Here, we developed a series of magnetic konjac glucomannan (KGM) aerogels as adsorbents for arsenite removal. These adsorbents were fabricated based on sodium montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) reinforced KGM matrix with magnetic Fe and Mn oxides (Mag-FMBO) inside. The obtained aerogels adsorbents were characterized by using compression test, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characteristic results showed that the composite aerogels possessed strong mechanical and magnetic property, excellent thermal characteristic and tunable pore structure. Batch adsorption tests were used to evaluate arsenite removal capacity. The adsorption results exhibited that the arsenite removal process was pH-dependent, followed a pseudo-second-order rate equation and Langmuir monolayer adsorption. The maximum arsenite uptake capacity of magnetic aerogels M1.5 reached 16.03 mg g−1 according to Langmuir isotherm at pH 7 and 323 K. Besides, the magnetic composite aerogels can be repeatedly used after the treatment of regenerant (NaOH/NaCl/NaClO solution).

Film formation was initiated by the adsorption of the polyphenol and directed by pH-dependent, multivalent coordination bonding. The prepared metal-TA coated zein NPs (zein-TA/metal NPs) demonstrated good stability to maintain particle size in cell culture medium at 37 °C. The microstructure of the NPs was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). To confirm the surface chemical information of the NPs, XPS analysis was performed. Furthermore, in vitro viability studies revealed that the zein-TA/metal NPs showed no significant cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells for 24 h. Because of the pH-responsive coordination bonding between TA and metal ions, the functional property of the metal-TA films was tailored for drug delivery.

This work studied the influence of Ly–CMC coacervates on the binding, solubility and stability of Cur. The interactions of Cur with Ly–CMC coacervates were researched by UV–vis, steady-state fluorescence, synchronous fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra. These results were explained in terms of the formation of Ly–CMC coacervates with electrostatic interaction, which led to unfold the structure of Ly for providing Cur with more hydrophobic microenvironment than free Ly. Meanwhile, the CMC of higher DS provide more negative charges, and produce more attraction to Ly than that of lower DS values. Moreover, the coacervates of Ly–CMC of higher DS are found to be superior for enhancing the stability of Cur.

Understanding the interactions between protein- and polysaccharide-based elements may offer unique opportunities in developing food products with well-defined functional properties. In this study, the synergistic effects of konjac glucomannan (KGM) on functional properties of egg white protein (EWP) were investigated. The results showed that KGM could increase the hardness, chewiness and springiness of the gel samples at a certain concentration. The presence of KGM was observed to be detrimental to foaming capacity of EWP, while foam stability enhanced. What is more, the emulsifying activity and emulsion stability significantly improved with the increase of KGM concentration, reaching the maximum at 0.08 wt%. In addition, the thermal and rheological properties showed that KGM enhanced the thermal stability of the blending system, and had a significant influence on the sol–gel transition temperature of samples.

Nano Cu2O was immobilized and evenly distributed in the matrix and Cu2O tended to grow on the GO sheets. Cu2O inside the matrix excite and generate free photoelectrons and electron holes, which was responsible for the degradation of dyes, while GO transferred the yielded photoelectrons to prevent the generation of local high potential zone and induce the chain degradation at more points. So it was found that the porous chitin film could load Cu2O and graphene at the same time, controlling the size of Cu2O and leading to easy recycle and reuse of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the introduction of GO has dramatically improved the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O in the Cu2O/GO/RC film, showing great potential application in wastewater treatment utilizing solar energy.

After 8 h of ball milling, the particle size of KF decreased from 152 μm to 19.8 μm. The structural change of KF was characterized by repose angle, GPC-MALLS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope. The results indicated that longer ball-milling time lead to higher repose angle, lower molecular weight and coarser surface of KF. Compared with native KF, the 4 h ball-milled KF achieved the shortest floating lag time, the longest floating duration time and the best controlled-release properties when used as excipients in floating drug release system. The water distribution in tablets with different dissolution time was observed by Magnetic resonance imagining (Wolk and Dahan).

The K/C powders were selectively soluble in aqueous solutions of different pH. Meanwhile, the coated chitosan could largely decrease the viscosity of KGM in neutral condition, which is the main limitation for KGM application in food industry. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), swelling ability and rheological measurements were utilized to characterize the performance of K/C powders. K/C powders exhibited much higher viscosity and swelling ability in acidic condition than in neutral condition. Therefore, this study will extend the application of KGM in food industry and in other pH-specific applications as well.

Pyrene and isothiocyanate were introduced as fluorescent probes to research the hydrophobic area of the NGs and cells endocytosis, respectively. Methotrexate (MTX) was used to investigate the drug encapsulation property of the NGs. It turned out to be that the drug loaded NGs were regular spherical shape with a hydrodynamic diameter of about 123 nm. The drug loading efficiency was about 14.2%. The NGs can slowly release the drug and increase the bioavailability of the loaded drug. The NGs are promising carriers for the delivery of drugs and other bioactive molecules.

The fabricated NPs were investigated for the first time to encapsulate and protect curcumin (Cur). The particle size and zeta potential of the zein–HTCC NPs varied from 66 to 170 nm and +36.3 to +62.5 mV, respectively. The encapsulation efficiency (EE) was greatly improved to 94.9% after HTCC coating, compared with 85.2% that using zein as a single encapsulant. The microstructure of the NPs was revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The physicochemical and structural analysis showed that the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds were the major forces responsible for the formation of NPs. The encapsulation forms were evaluated for their efficiency in overcoming Cur's heat and UV sensitivity, which improve the stability about 2.7 fold, 3.5 fold and 2.5 fold when disposed with 60 °C treatment for 30 min, 80 °C treatment for 1 min and ultraviolet radiation for 2 h, respectively at zein–HTCC1 = 1 : 1. The results of the stability and DPPH assays indicated that the bioactivity was being protected upon encapsulation.

Under optimal conditions, the stable nanogels were of spherical shape with an average diameter of about 90 nm, PDI < 0.3 and a zeta potential −35 mV. Furthermore, the cationic anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX) was effectively encapsulated into LDL/CMC nanogels with an exceptionally high encapsulation efficiency of ∼98%. The release of DOX from DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels was pH-dependent, and DOX was released at a quicker rate at pH 6.2 than at pH 7.4. Importantly, the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels were shown to effectively kill cancer cells in vitro. The IC50 of the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels in HeLa and HepG2 cells was approximately 2.45 and 1.72 times higher than that of free DOX. The slightly reduced antitumor efficacy was primarily due to the less cellular uptake of the DOX-LDL/CMC nanogels, which was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and flow cytometry analysis. The high DOX payload and pH-dependent drug release rendered LDL/CMC nanogels as an efficient carrier for doxorubicin and possibly be used for other cationic drugs in different biomedical applications.

At the first day of hydrolysis, KGM microcrystals were formed. With the extension of hydrolysis time, the particle size of KGM microcrystals decreased from 45 μm to 15 μm. In addition, compared with native KGM, the morphological, physicochemical, crystalline, and thermal properties of KGM microcrystals changed significantly. SEM images showed the irregular shapes and rough surfaces of KGM microcrystals as well as the smooth surface of native KGM. FTIR measurements revealed the cleavage of carbonyl groups in KGM microcrystals. XRD curves clearly presented the crystalline structure of KGM microcrystals, and the relative crystallinity increased to approximately 50%. DSC analysis showed that microcrystals had a better thermal stability than native KGM, which could be preferably used as reinforcement in the biocompatible material at high temperature.

The emulsifying properties of OVA–CMC conjugates were strengthened remarkably with increasing substitution degree of CMC. The foam stability of OVA–CMC conjugates was improved strongly with the extension of incubation time while the foaming ability decreased. The rheological behaviors of all the three grafted products were similar. With the incubation time extension, it took more time for the formation of the protein gel network, and the thermal denaturation temperature of protein became higher.

The results showed that the phase behavior of OVA–CMC conjugates was related to pH and concentration of CMC and NaCl. When pH was over 5.0, discrete phase separation occurred in the mixture system, which indicated that OVA and CMC were thermodynamic incompatible. The mixture system turned into uniform stable emulsion system when pH reduced below 5.0. The addition of NaCl can improve the stability of composite system against pH sensitivity.

The microstructures of the phase separated mixtures were studied by measuring rheological property and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The phase behavior of OVA/KGM mixtures appeared to be one single phase or two separated phases depending on the content of OVA and KGM. OVA had a pronounced effect on turbidity of OVA/KGM mixtures. The particle size of mixtures increased with increasing OVA and KGM concentration, which was the largest (119.1 μm) at 0.25 wt.% KGM and 5 wt.% OVA.

The antioxidant activities of CEEH were investigated by employing three in vitro assays, including the 2,2′‐azinobis‐(3‐ethylbenzthiazoline‐6‐sulfonate)/1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picrylhydrazyl (ABTS/DPPH)/hydroxyl radical‐scavenging assays. The radical‐scavenging effect of CEEH (1.0 mg/mL) was in a dose‐dependent manner, with the highest trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity for ABTS, DPPH, and that of hydroxyl radicals found to be 569, 2097, and 259.6 μmol/L, respectively; whereas the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity of unhatched egg for ABTS, DPPH, and that of hydroxyl radicals were found to be 199, 993, and 226.5 μmol/L, respectively. CEEH showed stronger scavenging activity than the hydrolysates of unhatched egg against free radicals such as ABTS, DPPH, and hydroxyl radicals. The antioxidant amino acid analysis indicated that the 14‐day CEEH possess more antioxidant amino acids than that of the unhatched egg. In addition, essential amino acids analysis showed that the 14‐day CEEH have the highest nutritional value. Combined with the results of the amino acid profiles, CEEH were believed to have higher nutritive value in addition to antioxidant activities than the unhatched egg.

However, commercial KF is usually light-colored with low KGM content, fish-like smell and low viscosity. In this paper, a one-step procedure, azeotropy-assisted acidic ethanol, was explored to elevate the overall quality of KF. Composition, transparency, color and odor evaluation, rheological properties and morphology of all the disposed KF were measured to evaluate the quality as compared with commercial KF. KF with 90% (w/w) KGM content could be easily obtained by pH regulation. At the high pH level (4.5–5.5), the quality of disposed KF was greatly improved, included by purity, transparency, and odor evaluation. Both the rheological properties and morphology observation verified the elevated effect. But the quality of KF was inclined to be poor at low pH level (2.5–4.0) due to KGM hydrolysis. The obtained white-colored Y4.5 with light fish smell tended to possess the highest viscosity and stability. The results illustrated washing by acidic ethanol at azeotropy point was feasible to effectively improve the quality of KF.

Three concentrations of konjac glucomannan (KGM) were applied to prepare micronized konjac gel. The best combination of fat analogue used in mayonnaise was 4.0 wt% konjac glucomannan and 0.36 wt% sodium carbonate. Then fat was partially substituted by micrometre-scale konjac gel at levels of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60% which were referred to as R10, R20, R30, R40, R50, or R60 formulations, respectively while the full fat (R0) mayonnaise without konjac gel substitution was used as a control experiment. The effects of substitution ratio was determined by rheology measurements, colour measurements, optical microscope observation and caloric values analysis which indicated that fat in mayonnaises substituted with konjac gel of not more than 30% was acceptable. At the meanwhile, the product has good storage stability in a certain storage period. This study shows good potential for spent micronized konjac gel to be used as a fat analogue in mayonnaise.

Herein the dissolution behavior of deacetylated KGM (da-KGM) was studied in 10 wt% urea solution at various temperatures. KGM with different degrees of deacetylation (DD) could be well dissolved at −4 °C. Low temperature was conducive to the dissolution of da-KGM. The result from steady shear showed that the zero-shear viscosity decreased with the increase of DD, with the rheological model being conformed to the Cross equation. Dynamic viscoelastic properties indicated the da-KGM gel formed more easily with increasing concentration, or decreasing temperature and DD. Temperature sweep revealed that gel process could be divided into two stages. The first stage was that both storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) fell until the temperature reached 90 °C. The second stage was that G′ and G″ increased abruptly, presenting the transition from sol to gel.	Deacetylated konjac glucomannan,Solubility,Dissolution,Rheological,Urea	2014-01-01 00:00:00

The results revealed that high alkalinity and high temperature had a synergetic effect on degradation. The structure of hydrolysates was evaluated by periodate oxidation and their fluidly properties were researched by rheology measurements. The degradation was divided into two regimes. The rate of the first regime (within 1 h) is higher than that of the second one (last 1 h). It is found that alkaline hydrolysis and deacetylation have a synergistic effect on the degradation under high alkalinity (pH 9.2) and low temperature condition (25 °C). Finally, rheology parameters showed alkaline-thermal degradation is a promising way that can be applied in practice to degrade KGM.

Surface properties of these obtained films were studied by contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy (ATM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS). The above results showed that the surface hydrophilicity and roughness of the films increased after the plasma treatment.

It was found that the values of gel strength and WHC reached the summit as the addition of KGM at 0.06 wt.%. Multi-exponential function analysis of the T2 relaxation revealed that there were at least two categories of water with different states or mobility in egg white gel. Meanwhile, intrinsic T2 relaxation time of the immobile water in blending gel was longer than the bound water during gelation. The distribution of water in egg white gel was characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which corresponded well with the conclusion of WHC. Further, scanning electron micrographs (SEM) suggested that WHC in the protein gel network was related to more porous gel microstructure.

Molecular parameters and structure of KGM samples were determined by GPC–MALLS and FT-IR spectroscopy. It was found that water solubility of KGM decreased with increasing DD, providing evidence further that the presence of acetyl groups confers water solubility on KGM. Rheological measurements suggested that hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction are both presented in KGM gels, hydrophobic interaction was strengthened whilst hydrogen bonding was weakened with increasing DD. A faster gelation rate and a more elastic modulus were facilitated by raising temperature or increasing KGM sample concentration.

The degree of deacetylation (DDA) was determined by acid–base titration while the structural changes of the regenerated chitin after alkali-freezing treatment were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the formation and growth of ice crystal during the slowly freezing process could break the intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds, disorganize the ordered molecular structure, destruct the compact crystal structure and decline the crystallinity. However, such structural damage was unstable and reversible. Nevertheless, the study explained that the alkali-freezing treatment was beneficial for further modification of chitin, which could significantly promote its solubility and accelerate the chemical reaction rate, while it could also keep its main molecular chains completely.

The instrument was used to measure rice powder and whole rice. Pearson correlation coefficients and sample paired t-test on total color difference (ΔE), L and b values were calculated. The value of ΔE of samples from the instrumental technique was 0.69–4.61 (powder), 4.7–10.2 (whole rice) with a coefficient of variance (CV) ranging from 3.5 to 25.3% and from 15.4 to 46.6%. Meanwhile, the digital image technique gave a ΔE value ranging from 4.2 to 13.77 with a CV from 6.3 to 21.2%, respectively. A highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.7451, R2 = 0.8074, R2 = 0.7518,) was obtained for ΔE between instrumental (powder and whole rice), Vision Builder and instrumental (powder), and instrumental (whole rice) and Vision Builder. The chromatic b value of instrumental for powder had a significant correlation with the Vision Builder data (R2 = 0.7741). The results suggest that although the digital image provided the surface color of parboiled rice, it was less accurate than the instrumental for powder.

Emerging evidence suggests that other structural features of nucleosomes also contribute to precise targeting of downstream chromatin complexes, such as linker DNA, the histone globular domain, and nucleosome spacing. However, how chromatin complexes coordinate individual interactions to achieve high affinity and specificity remains unclear. The Rpd3S histone deacetylase utilizes the chromodomain-containing Eaf3 subunit and the PHD domain-containing Rco1 subunit to recognize nucleosomes that are methylated at lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me). We showed previously that the binding of Eaf3 to H3K36me can be allosterically activated by Rco1. To investigate how this chromatin recognition module is regulated in the context of the Rpd3S complex, we first determined the subunit interaction network of Rpd3S. Interestingly, we found that Rpd3S contains two copies of the essential subunit Rco1, and both copies of Rco1 are required for full functionality of Rpd3S. Our functional dissection of Rco1 revealed that besides its known chromatin-recognition interfaces, other regions of Rco1 are also critical for Rpd3S to recognize its nucleosomal substrates and functionin vivo. This unexpected result uncovered an important and understudied aspect of chromatin recognition. It suggests that precisely reading modified chromatin may not only need the combined actions of reader domains but also require an internal signaling circuit that coordinates the individual actions in a productive way	chromatin, histone deacetylase (HDAC), histone modification, PHD finger, transcription	2016-01-01 00:00:00

The functional properties of Web services assure correct functionality of cloud applications, while the nonfunctional properties such as reliability might significantly influence the user-perceived availability evaluation. Reliability rankings provide valuable information for making optimal cloud service selection from a set of functionallyequivalent candidate services. There existed several approaches that can conduct reliability ranking prediction for Web services. Those approaches acquire different rankings with different preference functions. It is arduous to determine whether there exists the best one in them, and what is the best one if not. This paper proposes a learning approach to reliability ranking prediction for Web services which utilizes past service invocation logs to train preference function. To validate the proposed approach, large-scale experiments are conducted based on a realworld Web service dataset, WSDream.

It has been linked to the regulation of acetylation states, histone exchange, alternative splicing, DNA repair and recombination. Set2 is recruited to transcribed chromatin through its SRI domain's direct association with phosphorylated Pol II. However, regulatory mechanisms for histone modifying enzymes like Set2 that travel with elongating Pol II remain largely unknown beyond their initial recruitment events. Here, by fusing Set2 to RNA Pol II, we found that the SRI domain can also recognize linker DNA of chromatin, thereby controlling Set2 substrate specificity. We also discovered that an auto-inhibitory domain (AID) of Set2 primarily restricts Set2 activity to transcribed chromatin and fine-tunes several functions of SRI. Finally, we demonstrated that AID mutations caused hyperactive Set2 in vivo and displayed a synthetic interaction with the histone chaperone FACT. Our data suggest that Set2 is intrinsically regulated through multiple mechanisms and emphasize the importance of a precise temporal control of H3K36 methylation during the dynamic transcription elongation process.

It uses weighted bipartite software networks to represent classes, packages, and their dependencies; it proposes a guidance community detection algorithm (GUIDA) to obtain the optimized package structure; and it finally provides a list of classes as refactoring candidates by comparing the optimized package structure with the real package structure. Through a set of experiments we have shown that the proposed approach is able to identify a majority of classes that experts recognize as refactoring candidates, and the benefits of our approach are illustrated in comparison with other two approaches.

Understanding their evolutions can lead to better software engineering practices. In this paper, the authors use complex network theory as a tool to analyze the evolution of object-oriented (OO) software from a multigranularity perspective. First, a multi-granularity software networks model is proposed to represent the topological structures of a multi-version software system from three levels of granularity. Then, some parameters widely used in complex network theory are applied to characterize the software networks. By tracing the parameters’ values in consecutive software systems, we have a better understanding about software evolution. A case study is conducted on an open source OO project, Azureus, as an example to illustrate our approach, and some underlying evolution characteristics are uncovered. These results provide a different dimension to our understanding of software evolutions and also are very useful for the design and development of OO software systems.

To measure the complexity at various levels of granularity, namely graph, class (and object) and source code, we propose a hierarchical set of metrics in terms of coupling and cohesion — the most important characteristics of software, and analyze a sample of 12 open-source OO software systems to empirically validate the set. Experimental results of the correlations between cross-level metrics indicate that the graph measures of our set complement traditional software metrics well from the viewpoint of network thinking, and provide more effective information about fault-prone classes in practice.

Information Sciences	School of Mathematics and Statistics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China;Beijing Key Laboratory on MCAACI, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China	li_bingzhao@bit.edu.cn	The purpose of this paper is to present a quantitative SNR analysis of quadratic frequency modulated (QFM) signals. This analysis is located in the continuous-time local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT) domain using a Gaussian window function based on the definition of 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). First, the maximum value of the local polynomial periodogram (LPP), and the 3 dB bandwidth in the LPFT domain for a QFM signal is derived, respectively. Then, based on these results, the 3 dB SNR of a QFM signal with Gaussian window function is given in the LPFT domain with one novel idea highlighted: the relationship among standard SNR, parameters of QFM signals and Gaussian window function is clear, and the potential application is demonstrated in the parameter estimation of a QFM signal using the LPFT. Moreover, the 3 dB SNR in the LPFT domain is compared with that in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain. The validity of theoretical derivations is confirmed via simulation results. It is shown that, in terms of SNR, QFM signals in the LPFT domain can achieve a significantly better performance than those in the LCT domain.

As a further generalization of WL, a new definition for the WVD associated with the offset linear canonical transform (OLCT) is given.

The capabilities of the PLCT and the 2-D LCTS on image representation are analyzed. The experimental results show that the 2-D LCTS has much stronger capability on the image representation with respect to characters, and has better invariance of scale and noise than the other transforms. Moreover, due to the varieties of parameters, the performance of the image representation is going bad when parameters used in the reconstructing process are inconsistent with those in the decomposing process. In other words, the proposed transforms can be used for the protection of the image safety because they have free parameters than the traditional methods	Image representation,Orthogonal moments and transforms,2-D linear canonical transform,Polar harmonic linear canonical transform,2-D linear canonical transform series,Kernel,Transform coefficients,Parameter sensitivity	2015-12-01 00:00:00

Finally, the simulations are clearly performed to verify the well capabilities of the transforms on image watermarking, which show that the proposed transforms with suitable parameters outperform the traditional PHTs.

There are exist lots of speech signal models, such as speech sinusoidal model, straight speech model, AM–FM model, gaussian mixture model and so on. This paper investigates AM–FM speech model by the linear canonical transform (LCT). The LCT can be considered as a generalization of traditional Fourier transform and fractional Fourier transform, and proved to be one of the powerful tools for non-stationary signal processing. This has opened up the possibility of a new range of potentially promising and useful applications based on the LCT. Firstly, two novel recovery methods of speech based on the AM–FM model are presented in this paper: one depends on the LCT domain filtering; the other one is based on the chirp signal parameter estimation to restore the speech signal in LCT domain. Then, experiments results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed methods. Finally, the summarization and the conclusion of the paper is given.

Most of the published papers about the sampling theory require signals to be bandlimited in the FT domain and assume that the sample locations and the band width are all known. However, the sample locations are not always known and most of the signals are non-stationary in practical applications. In order to overcome these shortcomings, this paper provides an algorithm for approximating signals from nonuniform samples at unknown locations.

The circumscription and phylogeny of the genus have been ambiguous and its species had been included in various genera such as Colysis, Dendroglossa, Kontumia, Microsorum, and Paraleptochilus. Previous molecular studies sampled only 2–4 molecular markers and 2–16 accessions of Leptochilus. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 105 accessions representing ca. 40 species of Leptochilus, including types of Colysis, Kontumia, Leptochilus, and Paraleptochilus, 39 species of six non-Leptochilus genera of Microsoroideae, and one species of Pyrrosia, are used to infer a phylogeny. Our major results include: (1) Leptochilus is monophyletic and resolved as nested within the microsoroid ferns, but its relationships with other members of Microsoroideae are not well resolved; (2) Six well-supported major clades in Leptochilus are recognized, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features; (3) Species related to L. macrophyllus representing earliest split in Leptochilus are identified; (4) The inclusion of Microsorum pteropus in Leptochilus is confirmed, whereas M. insigne is closely related to Leptochilus but not resolved as a member of the genus; (5) The species number of the genus is likely to double the most recent estimate following our study, and quite a few cryptic species should be recognized; and (6) A basal grade formed by three major clades is recovered and they are composed of species almost exclusively distributed at lower latitudes (the Malay Archipelago), whereas the shallow-level clades contain species distributed at mainly higher latitudes, suggesting that Leptochilus might have evolved at lower latitudes and progressively dispersed to and colonized higher latitudes.

Estimates of species number range from 40 to 200. Previous molecular works included only 2–17 accessions representing 2–12 species of Arachniodes and allied genera, leaving most of the Asian species remain unsampled and the infragneric relationships unclear. In this study DNA sequences of seven plastid markers of 343 accessions representing ca. 68 species of Arachniodes (275 accessions), and 64 outgroup accessions from subfam. Dryopteridoideae and subfam. Polybotryoideae were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) Two species currently assigned in Arachniodes (A. macrostegia and A. ochropteroides are resolved outside of the core Arachniodes making the currently defined Arachniodes polyphyletic, confirming earlier findings; (2) Lithostegia, Leptorumohra, and Phanerophlebiopsis are indeed synonyms of Arachniodes; (3) Leptorumohra is confirmed to be monophyletic, but Phanerophlebiopsis is polyphyletic; (4) The New World species of Arachniodes are confirmed to be not monophyletic with A. denticulata being nested within the Old World species, suggesting that this species is dispersed from the Old World; (5) Arachniodes s.s is resolved into 12 major clades, some of which are further divisable into recognizable subclades and groups, with A. mutica from Japan being resolved as the sister to the rest of the genus; (6) A number of systematic implications of the phylogeny have been suggested; and (7) the genus is estimated to contain ca. 83 species.

Lin & Viane (2013) noted that “Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z.Y.Liu, described from Sichuan [Chongqing], may represent a species of its own although it was considered a synonym of A. unilaterale Lamarck (1786: 305) s.l. by Wu (FRPS 4(2): 38. 1999); it is similar to Hymenasplenium murakami-hatanakae Nakaike (1992: 841) but differs in its gray, hairy cales and its more medial sori.” After careful morphological study by comparing the type of A. pubirhizoma with that of H. murakami-hatanakae (Type: CHINA. Taiwan: In monte Tampui Cascades, November 1913, Faurie 151, S-P- 1599!), we agree with Lin & Viane (2013) that the gray scales and medial sori of A. pubirhizoma are different from the brown to dark brown scales and (sub)marginal sori of H. murakami-hatanakae, and officially transfer this species from Asplenium to Hymenasplenium.

Box 416, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China; Missouri Botanical Garden, 4344 Shaw Blvd., St. Louis, MO 63110, USA	Libing.Zhang@mobot.org	The fern genus Hymenasplenium (Aspleniaceae) is one of the two genera in the family. It is generally recognized among modern pteridologists. However, its infrageneric relationships and species diversity have been unclear and controversial. The molecular studies so far have had small taxon and character sampling. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 158 accessions representing ca. 40 out of ca. 50 known species of Hymenasplenium, and 16 species of Asplenium were used to infer a phylogeny with maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony approaches. Our major results include: (1) Hymenasplenium as currently defined is strongly supported as monophyletic; (2) three major clades representing early splits in Hymenasplenium are identified, with the Old World species being strongly supported as monophyletic; it is ambiguous if the New World species are monophyletic; (3) extensive cryptic speciation in the Old World is discovered demonstrating the complexity of evolution of the genus; and (4) six strongly or moderately supported subclades in the Old World clade are revealed, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features.

This paper examines personal informatics practices and challenges in migraine, a condition characterized by unpredictable, intermittent, and poorly-understood symptoms. To investigate how people with migraine track and use data related to their condition, we surveyed 279 people with migraine and conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 survey respondents and 6 health providers. We find four distinct goals people bring to tracking and data: 1) answering questions about migraines, 2) predicting and preventing migraines, 3) monitoring and managing migraines over time, and 4) enabling motivation and social recognition. Each goal suggests different needs for the design of tools to support migraine tracking. We also find needs resulting from an individual's goals evolving over time, their varied personal experiences, and their communication and collaboration with providers. We discuss these goals and needs in terms of opportunities for personal informatics tools to facilitate learning to: 1) avoid common pitfalls; 2) support customization and flexibility; 3) account for burden, negativity, and lapsing; and 4) support management with uncertainty.

To understand menstrual cycle tracking practices, we collected and analyzed data from three sources: 2,000 reviews of popular menstrual tracking apps, a survey of 687 people, and follow-up interviews with 12 survey respondents. We find that women track their menstrual cycle for varied reasons that include remembering and predicting their period as well as informing conversations with healthcare providers. Participants described six methods of tracking their menstrual cycles, including use of technology, awareness of their premenstrual physiological states, and simply remembering. Although women find apps and calendars helpful, these methods are ineffective when predictions of future menstrual cycles are inaccurate. Designs can create feelings of exclusion for gender and sexual minorities. Existing apps also generally fail to consider life stages that women experience, including young adulthood, pregnancy, and menopause. Our findings encourage expanding the field's conceptions of personal informatics.

Through this approach, they aim to lower the capture burdens, collect data that is typically hard to track automatically, and promote awareness to help people achieve their self-monitoring goals. They first specify three design considerations for semi-automated tracking: data capture feasibility, the purpose of self-monitoring, and the motivation level. They then provide examples of semi-automated tracking applications in the domains of sleep, mood, and food tracking to demonstrate strategies they developed to find the right balance between manual tracking and automated tracking, combining each of their benefits while minimizing their associated limitations.	self-monitoring,semi-automated tracking,personal informatics,sleep tracking,food tracking,mood tracking,pervasive computing,healthcare,mobile,Internet of Things,bioinformatics,data analysis	2017-01-01 00:00:00

We explore how designs can support people when they lapse in tracking, considering how to design data representations for a person who lapses in Fitbit use. Through a survey of 141 people who had lapsed in using Fitbit, we identified three use patterns and four perspectives on tracking. Participants then viewed seven visual representations of their Fitbit data and seven approaches to framing this data. Participant Fitbit use and perspective on tracking influenced their preference, which we surface in a series of contrasts. Specifically, our findings guide selecting appropriate aggregations from Fitbit use (e.g., aggregate more when someone has less data), choosing an appropriate framing technique from tracking perspective (e.g., ensure framing aligns with how the person feels about tracking), and creating appropriate social comparisons (e.g., portray the person positively compared to peers). We conclude by discussing how these contrasts suggest new designs and opportunities in other tracking domains.	Personal Informatics; Lapsing; Abandonment; Re-engagement	2016-09-01 00:00:00

Several existing approaches promote healthy eating, but present high barriers and yield limited engagement. As a lightweight alternative approach to promoting mindful eating, we introduce and examine crumbs: daily food challenges completed by consuming one food that meets the challenge. We examine crumbs through developing and deploying the iPhone application Food4Thought. In a 3 week field study with 61 participants, crumbs supported engagement and mindfulness while offering opportunities to learn about food. Our 2x2 study compared nutrition versus non-nutrition crumbs coupled with social versus non-social features. Nutrition crumbs often felt more purposeful to participants, but non-nutrition crumbs increased mindfulness more than nutrition crumbs. Social features helped sustain engagement and were important for engagement with non-nutrition crumbs. Social features also enabled learning about the variety of foods other people use to meet a challenge.	Food; daily challenges; mindfulness; personal informatics	2016-05-01 00:00:00

We build upon prior work by embracing the perspective of lived informatics to propose a new model of personal informatics. We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, integration, and reflection as components of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of tracking.

Prior work has identified several barriers to use as well as discrepancies between designer goals and how these features are used in practice. We develop a framework for designing and evaluating these features based on an extensive review of prior literature. We demonstrate the value of this framework by analyzing physical activity sharing on Twitter, coding 4,771 tweets and their responses and gathering 444 reactions from 97 potential tweet recipients, learning that specific user-generated content leads to more responses and is better received by the post audience. We conclude by extending our findings to other sharing problems and discussing the value of our design framework.

Although applications capture fine-grained activity for self reflection, sharing is generally limited to high level summaries. There are potential advantages to fine-grained sharing, but also potential harms. To help investigate this complex design space, we employ Value Sensitive Design to consider whether and how to share fine grained step activity. We identify key values and value tensions, and we develop scenarios to highlight these. We then design a set of data transformations that seek to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms of detailed sharing. These include a novel approach to interactive modification of fine grained step data, allowing people to remove private data and using motif discovery to generate realistic replacement data. Finally, we conduct semi structured interviews with 12 participants examining these scenarios and transformations. We distill results into a set of design considerations for fine-grained physical activity sharing.

We argue that Southern theory is not an on-the-shelf solution to global geopolitical inequalities but a work in process that is important both for the global South and to simultaneously dethrone and enrich Northern, mainstream theory. The article begins with a prologue explaining the origins and profile of the particular politics of knowledge production discussed in this issue. In the next section, we consider the notion of the ‘global South’ and trace the way in which knowledge itself is imprinted with the legacies of imperialism and colonialism, both in the North and in the South, with different agendas for theory arising from the historical positions of each. We then offer a very brief contextualisation of the issue in the specific context of South Africa, drawing on the articles to explore the particular nuances and issues raised by its particular historical and geopolitical location. In so doing, we point to some of the very difficult questions raised by the relationship between indigenous and modernist (Northern) knowledges. We move on to suggest some ways of thinking about intervening to challenge and potentially alleviate inequalities, showing that policy is not enough. In conclusion, we return to Southern theory, noting some of the limitations to which a journal like Gender and Education can contribute and the journey yet to travel while celebrating the fact and nature of this issue as a contribution to the development of Southern theory from and in South Africa.

This article shows how amphiphilicity may be added to sub-2-nm metal NCs by patching hydrophilic NCs (e.g., Au25(MHA)18 NCs where MHA is 6-mercaptohexanoic acid) with hydrophobic cations (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium ion, CTA+) to about half of a monolayer coverage. Specifically we demonstrate the preparation of amphiphilic Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9 where x is the number of CTA+ per NC) by the phase-transfer (PT) driven ion-paring reaction between CTA+ and −COO– (derived from the deprotonation of the terminal carboxyl group of MHA). Due to the coexistence of flexible hydrophilic MHA and hydrophobic MHA···CTA ligands in comparable amounts on the NC surface, the Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9) exhibit good amphiphilicity, which enabled them to dissolve in solvents with distinctly different polarities and to self-assemble like a molecular amphiphile. Consequently, the amphiphilic Au25(MHA)18@xCTA NCs (x = 6–9) could self-organize into stacked bilayers at the air–liquid interface, similar to the formation of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases by common surfactants. The good solubility and molecular-amphiphile-like self-assembly properties can significantly increase the utility of noble metal NCs in basic and applied research.	cations, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, ligands, nanoparticles, solubility, solvents, surfactants	2015-01-01 00:00:00

The actual performance of TMDs is however constrained by their limited electronic conductivity. For example, MoS2, the most studied TMD, does not have adequate rate performance even in the few-layer form or after compounding with nitrogen-doped graphene (NG). WS2, a TMD with a higher intrinsic electronic conductivity, is more suitable for high rate applications but its theoretical capacity is lower than that of MoS2. Hence, we hypothesize that a composition-optimized composite of MoS2, WS2, and NG may provide high capacity concurrently with good rate performance. This is a report on the design and preparation of double transition-metal chalcogenide (MoS2/WS2)-nitrogen doped graphene composites where the complementarity of component functions may be maximized. For example the best sample in this study could deliver a high discharge capacity of 1195 mAh·g–1 at 100 mA·g–1 concurrently with good cycle stability (average of 0.02% capacity fade per cycle for 100 cycles) and high rate performance (only 23% capacity reduction with a 50 fold increase in current density from 100 mA·g–1 to 5000 mA·g–1).

The effects of these cationic surfactants on the microstructures and electrochemical performances of the FL-MoS2/GNS for lithium storage are investigated. It is demonstrated the cationic surfactants show some ability to control the microstructure (layer number) of FL-MoS2 in composites. The electrochemical performances of FL-MoS2/GNS composites for lithium storage are greatly improved compared to the bare MoS2. Especially, FL-MoS2/GNS with ∼6 MoS2 layers prepared with the assistance of OTAB exhibits very high reversible capacity of ∼1200 mAh g−1 with excellent cycle stability and enhanced rate capability. Electrochemical impedance spectrum also confirms that the FL-MoS2/GNS composite electrodes exhibit much lower electron-transfer resistance than the MoS2. The remarkable electrochemical performances of FL-MoS2/GNS composites can be attributed to the synergistic interaction between FL-MoS2 and graphene and their quasi-3D architectures, which promote lithium diffusion, electron transfer and electrolyte access.

These TFC membranes contained a selective polyamide layer deposited by interfacial polymerization on a support substrate cast from a polymer blend of polysulfone (PSf) and sulfonated poly(phenylene oxide) (SPPO). The immobilized counter ions (Na+) in SPPO gave rise to an IOP which facilitated water transport in the AL–FS operating mode (i.e., the active layer is facing the feed solution, also referred to as the FO mode) but retarded water transport in the AL–DS operating mode (i.e., the active layer is facing the draw solution, also called as the pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode). An optimized TFC membrane could draw a water flux of 39 LMH (Lm−2 h−1) in the AL–FS mode, which is among the highest in the current literature; and 57 LMH in the AL–DS mode, which is comparable to other published works using deionized water as the feed and 2 M NaCl as the draw solution. The optimized SPPO/PSf TFC membrane also outperformed other published FO membranes in simulated seawater desalination. Extremely high water fluxes of 25 and 19 LMH could be obtained in the AL–DS and AL–FS modes respectively. The impressive high water flux in the AL–FS mode makes this membrane particularly suitable for FO operations where internal concentration polarization (ICP) and membrane fouling are major concerns.

The dense packing allows the conductive carbon coating to be interconnected into a continuous three-dimensional network for electron conduction. The porosity in the packed structure forms the complementary network for Li+ transport in the electrolyte. The primary particles are nanosized and Fe-substituted to improve the effectiveness of Li+ insertion and extraction reactions in the solid phase.

Hereby, an environmentally benign, simple, and scalable method for preparation of stable, linker-free, self-supported, high-order 3D meso-oblate spheroids of CuO nanoparticle aggregates with size-tunable building nanounits for reversible lithium-ion storage is reported. In contrast to traditional spherical nanoparticle aggregation, a unique oblate spheroid morphology is achieved. The formation mechanism of the unusual oblate spheroid of aggregated nanoparticles is proposed. When tested for reversible lithium ion storage, the unique 3D meso-oblate spheroids of CuO nanoparticle aggregate demonstrated highly improved electrochemical performance (around ∼600 mAh/g over 20 cycles), which could be ascribed to the nanoporous aggregated mesostructure with abundant crystalline imperfection. Furthermore, the size of building units can be controlled (12 and 21 nm were tested) to further improve their electrochemical performance.	CuO, aggregate, oblate-spheroid	2013-12-01 00:00:00

Through the careful control of the amount of carbon precursor (d(+)-glucose monohydrate) used in the process, LTO encapsulated with a continuous layer of nanoscale carbon was formed. The carbon encapsulation served a dual function: preserving the ball-in-ball morphology during the transformation from TiO2 to LTO and decreasing the external electron transport resistance. The fluoride doping of LTO not only increased the electron conductivity of LTO through trivalent titanium (Ti3+) generation, but also increased the robustness of the structure to repeated lithiation and delithiation. The best-performing composite, C-FLTO-2, therefore delivered a very satisfying performance for a LTO anode: a high charge capacity of ∼158 mA h g–1 at the 1 C rate with negligible capacity fading for 200 cycles and an extremely high rate performance up to 140 C.	lithium titanium oxide, fluoride doping, ball-in-ball morphology	2013-11-01 00:00:00

Here, the design of a theranostic nanocomposite capable of simultaneous targeting and imaging of the cancer cells is presented. It releases its drug payload by a controlled release mechanism. The nanocomposite contains luminescent gold nanocluster (L‐AuNC) photostable and biocompatible diagnostic probes conjugated to a folic acid (FA)‐modified pH‐responsive amphiphilic polymeric system for controlled drug release. The nanocomposite uses a core‐satellite structure to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs and releases the drug payload in mildly acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments by the action of the pH‐labile linkages in the polymer. In vivo studies show the selective accumulation of the FA‐conjugated nanocomposite in tumor tissues by folate‐receptor‐mediated endocytosis. These findings demonstrate the potential of the nanocomposite as a nontoxic, folate‐targeting, pH‐responsive drug carrier that is useful for the early detection and therapy of folate‐overexpressing cancerous cells.	self‐assembly,luminescent nanoclusters,amphiphilic polymer carriers,composite materials,biomedical applications	2013-09-01 00:00:00

The alkylation of the α,ω-diamine with BPPO resulted in a covalently cross-linked BPPO network where SPPO could be immobilized by interlocking. The interlocked structure was also strengthened by ion pair interactions between the sulfonic acid groups of SPPO and the amine moieties formed in cross-linking. The length of the aliphatic α,ω-diamine cross-linker was varied to modify the hydrophobicity and the mesh width (the average distance between two cross-linked polymer segments) of the cross-linked network host. The effects of these adjustments on the structure of the cross-linked network host were evaluated by the morphology of the hydrophilic domains, and transport properties such as proton conductivity and methanol permeability. It was found that the increase in mesh width and hydrophobicity of networks formed by long cross-linkers resulted in more scattered hydrophilic domains and fewer contiguous connections. On the contrary, the hydrophilic domains in networks with short cross-linkers were closer and more extensively-connected to facilitate proton transport. Methanol crossover in the SIPN membranes, on the other hand, could be suppressed by downsizing the size of the hydrophilic domains. Overall water uptake and dimensional swelling of the membranes were also affected by the cross-linker length. Some of the SIPN membranes delivered better performance than the Nafion® 117 membrane in single stack fuel cell tests, demonstrating the potential of SIPNs for the construction of fuel cell PEMs.	Semi-interpenetrating polymer network,Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide),Proton exchange membrane	2013-01-01 00:00:00

The open interior structure adapts well to the volume change in repetitive Li+ insertion and extraction reactions; and the encapsulating graphene connects the Fe3O4 nanoparticles electrically. The structure and morphology of the graphene-Fe3O4 composite were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission microscopy. The electrochemical performance of the composite for reversible Li+ storage was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charging and discharging. The results showed a high and nearly unvarying specific capacity for 50 cycles. Furthermore, even after 90 cycles of charge and discharge at different current densities, about 92% of the initial capacity at 100 mA g–1 was still recoverable, indicating excellent cycle stability. The graphene-Fe3O4 composite is therefore a capable Li+ host with high capacity that can be cycled at high rates with good cycle life. The unique combination of graphene encapsulation and a hollow porous structure definitely contributed to this versatile electrochemical performance.	graphene, anode material	2011-07-01 00:00:00

However, this high selectivity is often realized at the expense of catalytic activity. This study investigates the use of Ir modification to improve the performance of Pt–Rh catalysts. Specifically a series of Vulcan XC-72 carbon-supported Pt5Rh1Irx catalysts were prepared by the NaBH4 reduction of the metal precursors in ethylene glycol. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed good dispersion of ∼2.5 nm Pt–Rh–Ir nanoparticles on the carbon support. Evaluations of catalytic activity in 1 M ethanol solution in 0.1 M HClO4 by cyclic voltammetry (CV), polarization measurements, and chronoamperometry (CA) all indicated Pt5Rh1Ir0.6/C as the catalyst composition with the highest current density between 0.4 and 0.7 V. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) detected a decrease in the charge transfer resistance after the Ir modification, which could be attributed to an Ir-promoted, more facile cleavage of the C–H bonds in the ethanol molecule.

This study reports a versatile method for synthesizing polyhedral NCs enclosed by a variety of high-index Pd facets. The method is based on the heteroepitaxial growth of Pd layers on concave trisoctahedral (TOH) gold NC seeds under careful control of the growth kinetics. Polyhedral Au@Pd NCs with three different classes of high-index facets, including concave TOH NCs with {hhl} facets, concave hexoctahedral (HOH) NCs with {hkl} facets, and tetrahexahedral (THH) NCs with {hk0} facets, can be formed in high yield. The Miller indices of NCs are also modifiable, and we have used the THH NCs as a demonstrative example. The catalytic activities of these NCs were evaluated by the structure-sensitive reaction of formic acid electro-oxidation. The results showed that the high-index facets are generally more active than the low-index facets. In summary, a seeded growth process based on concave high-index faceted monometallic TOH NC templates and careful control of the growth kinetics is a simple and effective strategy for the synthesis of noble metal NCs with high-index facets. It also offers tailorability of the surface structure in shape-controlled synthesis.	Organic acids,Palladium,Metals,Gold,Transmission electron microscopy	2010-12-01 00:00:00

Analysis of the projection angles and the atomic arrangement in the edge-on facets suggests that the surface of the TOH NCs was bounded by high-index {hhl} facets, such as {221}, {331}, and/or {441}. The size of the TOH gold NCs could be increased stepwise from 55 to 120 nm by applying the seed-mediated growth in succession. The TOH gold NCs displayed size-dependent surface plasmon resonance (SPR) properties, with the SPR peak red shifting with the increase in the NC size. The presence of the high-index {hhl} facets on the TOH surface was confirmed by cyclic voltammetric features that are distinctively different from those of cubic and octahedral gold NCs. The formation of these TOH NCs was kinetically driven and governed by two main factors: (i) the preferential face-blocking adsorption of CTA+ on high-index facets and (ii) a favorable reduction rate of the metal ions in the growth solution. The uniformity of the TOH NCs in size and shape facilitated NC self-assembly into ordered hexagonal or square packing structures simply by solvent evaporation on a substrate.

However, the progress in peptide synthesis of metal nanoparticles has been slow due to the lack of peptide design rules. It is difficult to establish sequence−reactivity relationships from peptides isolated from biological sources (e.g., biomineralizing organisms) or selected by combinatorial display libraries because of their widely varying compositions and structures. The abundance of random and inactive amino acid sequences in the peptides also increases the difficulty in knowledge extraction. In this study, a “bottom-up” approach was used to formulate a set of rudimentary rules for the size- and shape-controlled peptide synthesis of gold nanoparticles from the properties of the 20 natural α-amino acids for AuCl4− reduction and binding to Au0. It was discovered that the reduction capability of a peptide depends on the presence of certain reducing amino acid residues, whose activity may be regulated by neighboring residues with different Au0 binding strengths. Another finding is the effect of peptide net charge on the nucleation and growth of the Au nanoparticles. On the basis of these understandings, several multifunctional peptides were designed to synthesize gold nanoparticles in different morphologies (nanospheres and nanoplates) and with sizes tunable by the strategic placement of selected amino acid residues in the peptide sequence. The methodology presented here and the findings are useful for establishing the scientific basis for the rational design of peptides for the synthesis of metal nanostructures.

The Pt-decorated PdFe nanoparticles, which consist of a PdPt surface and a PdFe interior, were prepared by the galvanic reaction between PdFe/C alloy nanoparticles and PtCl42− in aqueous solution. The presence of a Pt-enriched surface after the replacement reaction was independently confirmed by several microstructural characterization techniques and cyclic voltammetry. The catalyst with such heterogeneous architecture is catalytically more active than a bulk PdFePt alloy catalyst with the same overall composition. The observed enhancements in catalyst performance can be attributed to the lattice strain effect between the shell and core components. The Pt-decorated PdFe (PdFe@PdPt/C) catalyst also compares favorably with a commercial Pt/C catalyst with four times as much Pt in terms of ORR activity, cost, and methanol tolerance.	galvanic replacement reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, core shell nanoparticles, direct methanol fuel cells	2010-01-01 00:00:00

However, the fabrication and alignment of 1-D nanomaterials with specific geometry and composition on a given substrate is a significant challenge. Herein we show a successful example of fabricating a family of aligned 1-D C-curved nanoarches of different compositions on an extended Si surface by a simple and scalable method. The nanoarches are made up of either single-crystalline Sn nanorods encapsulated in carbon nanotubes (CNTs), SnO2 nanotubes, or CNTs. The aligned 1-D C-curved nanoarches of single-crystalline Sn nanorods in CNTs are prepared first by a facile in situ reduction of SnO2 nanoparticles under standard chemical vapor deposition conditions. Nanoarches of CNTs and SnO2 nanotubes were then derived from the Sn@CNT nanoarches by acid etching and by calcination in air, respectively.	carbon nanotube,SnO2 nanotube	2009-07-01 00:00:00

Size- and shape-controlled growth was made possible by the specific morphogenic action of the polypeptide pLAA and growth in a spatially confined environment. LPEI, in addition to serving as the counter polyelectrolyte for pLAA in the LbL assembly, also provided the facility for chloroaurate anion (AuCl4−) binding through its protonated amine groups (NH3+). The availability and accessibility of these binding sites were important to particle size control and could be varied by the pH of the pLAA solution used in the LbL assembly. Size-controlled synthesis of gold nanoplates was accomplished by controlling the secondary structure of pLAA in the multilayer film. In particular, an increase in the fraction of pLAA α-helices was found to increase the availability and accessibility of the reducing carboxyl side groups of pLAA, resulting in more facile reduction kinetics and smaller particle size in the product. The polypeptide-based reactive templates offered a finer level of kinetic control, enabling the formation of gold nanoplates in a size range (i.e., 50 nm) not possible in a solution phase synthesis (i.e., 500 nm), using reaction mixtures with the same overall composition (i.e., pLAA, LPEI, and HAuCl4) and under the same environmental conditions. The key parameters affecting the polypeptide film formation and their effects on the size-controlled synthesis of gold nanoplates were identified and discussed in detail in this report.

Ag nanoparticles were first prepared by a modified polyol method. The as-synthesized Ag nanoparticles were all icosahedral multiply twinned particles (MTPs) with notable size variations. The variability was reduced to less than 5% after a digestive ripening post treatment. The nearly monodisperse Ag nanoparticles were then used in replacement reactions with Au and Pd precursors to produce monodisperse icosahedral Au and Pd nanoparticles. The size of the monodisperse icosahedral Ag, Au, and Pd nanoparticles could also be increased thereafter by seed-mediated growth. The closely matched geometrical attributes of these icosahedral nanoparticles allowed them to easily self-assemble into 3-D superlattices either in the solution phase or on a solid substrate.	monodisperse, multiply twinned particles, nanoparticles	2009-02-01 00:00:00

Time-course measurements by UV−vis spectroscopy and TEM were used to follow the reaction progress and the evolution of the flower-like shape.

Proteins in the extract were involved in the biological synthesis, providing the dual function of Ag ion reduction and shape-controlled synthesis of nanosilver. Hydroxyl groups in Tyr residues and carboxyl groups in Asp and/or Glu residues were further identified as the most active functional groups for Ag ion reduction and for directing the anisotropic growth of Ag nanoplates, respectively. The kinetics of Ag ion reduction in biological systems was discussed and probed by using custom-designed peptides. The results showed the Tyr content (the reduction source) and the content of Ag complexers (the reaction inhibitors, e.g., His and Cys) in the protein molecules as important factors affecting the reduction kinetics. The comprehensive system identification effort has led to the design of a simple bifunctional tripeptide (DDY-OMe) with one Tyr residue as the reduction source and two carboxyl groups in the Asp residues as shape-directors, which could produce small Ag nanoplates with low polydispersivity in good yield (>55%). The roles of the carboxyl groups in the formation of Ag nanoplates were also discussed.	biosynthesis, silver, proteins	2008-01-01 00:00:00

The CA modification of carbon materials is both simple and effective. It requires no prolonged heating, filtration and washing, and produces more functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxide on CA-modified carbon nanotubes and XC72 carbon blacks than on HNO3–H2SO4 oxidized carbon nanotubes and as-purchased XC72. Platinum nanoparticles are deposited on these functionalized carbon materials by means of a microwave-assisted polyol process. The investigations using TEM, XRD, FTIR and TGA indicate that CA modification creates more functional groups and thus deposits more Pt nanoparticles with smaller average particle size on the surface of carbon materials. Electrochemical studies of the Pt/C samples for methanol oxidation reveal higher activity for Pt on CA-modified carbon materials. It is therefore considered that this method can find important applications in reducing the cost and improving performance of proton-exchange membrane fuel cells.

The PEM host matrix consisted of a hydrophobic three-component polymer blend (TCPB) of poly(4-vinylphenol-co-methylmethacrylate) P(4-VP-MMA), poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), and Paraloid® B-82 acrylic copolymer resins; in which a hydrophilic network of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid (AMPS), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol)dimethylacrylate (PEGDMA) was formed upon embedded polymerization. Colloidal PAn particles were added to the PEM matrix during the embedded polymerization of PEM. Two types of PAn colloidal particles with different chain structures and morphologies were synthesized by inverse miniemulsion polymerization and interfacial polymerization. The PAn(1) particles from inverse miniemulsion polymerization were bar-shaped, contained a higher fraction of quinoid diimine units than the scaffold-like PAn(2) particles from interfacial polymerization, and displayed a strong promotional effect on proton conduction. The oxidation state of the PAn particles was also varied by post-synthesis treatments to evaluate the effect of oxidation state on proton conduction. It was found that a mixed oxidation state such as the emeraldine form of PAn had the best enhancement effect. The PAn loading optimal for proton conductivity enhancement of the composite PEM was determined to be about 2 wt% of PAn(1).

The effects of environmental factors such as temperature and pH were investigated, which showed low temperature and acidic pH favoring the anisotropic growth of gold nanoparticles. More interestingly, the kinetics of chloroauric acid reduction in BSA solutions could be manipulated through the addition of a trace amount of Ag+ ions, and plates with lateral size ranging from a few micrometers to tens of nanometers could be produced.

The data show a strong and non-specific interaction between the two which can be exploited for the stabilization of Pt nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. Based on the experimental findings, a non-hybridization based protocol to assemble 17 nm Au and Pt nanoparticles (12 nm cubic and 3.6 nm spherical) by single-stranded DNA was developed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV–visible spectroscopy confirmed that Au and Pt nanoparticles could be assembled by the non-specific interaction in an orderly manner. The experimental results also caution against the potential pitfalls in using DNA melting point analysis to infer metal nanoparticle assembly by DNA hybridization.

It is believed that the low melting Sn core was hollowed out by electron beam irradiation of the sample during microscopy. The 2–5 nm tin oxide hollow nanoparticles and 80–120 nm tin oxide hollow nanocubes had thin but stable shells capable of preserving the integrity of the large cavity within.	core-shell nanostructures,hollow nanoparticles,nanocubes,nanomaterials,SnO2	2006-12-01 00:00:00

This study reports a new methanol-blocking polymer matrix which consists of a methanol barrier phase and an embedded proton source. A three-component polymer blend (TCPB) of poly(4-vinylphenol-co-methyl methacrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA), and Paraloid® B-82 acrylic copolymer resins is used as a methanol barrier. In order to implant a proton source in the membrane as homogeneously as possible, the hydrophilic monomers, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid (AMPS), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and a cross-linking agent (poly(ethylene glycol) dimethylacrylate) (PEGDMA) are polymerized after they have been embedded in the TCPB matrix. The embedded polymerization has resulted in an asymmetric membrane structure, in which the hydrophilic network is sandwiched by two outer layers of predominantly hydrophobic TCPB. Measurements are made of properties of the AMPS-containing membranes that are important to fuel cell applications such as water uptake, ion-exchange capacity, proton conductivity, methanol permeability and tensile strength. The highest proton conductivity of the AMPS-containing membrane is about 0.030 S cm−1 at 70 °C. The low methanol permeability (10−8 to 10−7 cm2 s−1) of the AMPS-containing membranes is their primary advantage for DMFC applications.

From cyclic and anodic CO-stripping voltammetric evaluation of catalyst activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in acidic solution at room temperature, the Pt-2/C catalyst, which has none of the attributes generally associated with a good Pt catalyst (small particle size, narrow size-distribution, high metal dispersion, low Pt oxidation state), demonstrated higher specific activity and improved CO tolerance than the conventionally prepared Pt-1/C, which has all the common features of a good Pt catalyst. It is concluded that the higher activity of Pt-2/C is linked to its surface oxygen species, which is present in greater abundance and in a more accessible form for reaction with the strongly adsorbed CO-like intermediates.

The results showed that the affinity of thiol for Pt nanoparticles increases with increasing particle size whereas the affinity of amine for Pt nanoparticles decreases. The divergence in binding affinities has resulted in differences in catalytic activities of thiol- and amine-protected Pt nanoparticles in the room temperature electro-oxidation of methanol (a fuel cell reaction). It was therefore possible for the larger Pt nanoparticles to be catalytically more active than the smaller Pt nanoparticles up to a certain critical size, before the surface area effects of nanoparticles become noticeable.	1-Dodecanethiol,Dodecylamine,Pt nanoparticle,Binding affinity,Methanol oxidation	2006-08-01 00:00:00

The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis and transmission electron microscopy, and their activities in room temperature methanol electrooxidation were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and benchmarked against a commercial E-TEK catalyst with the same Pt loading. TEM showed smaller Pt particles if citrate was present in the synthesis, with average particle sizes of 4.0 and 2.2 nm for Pt-1 and Pt-3, respectively. While the presence of citrate was generally beneficial to forming smaller and more uniform Pt nanoparticles, a large excess of citrate (H2Cyt−:PtCl62− = 20:1) in the microwave synthesis had led to a decrease in catalytic activity. The microwave-synthesized Pt/C obtained using a smaller excess of citrate (H2Cyt−:PtCl62− = 5:1) demonstrated the best mass activity, surpassing the performance of the commercial catalyst. In addition, a size effect was found in this study: with the decrease in the platinum particle size in the range of 2.2–4 nm, the specific activity of Pt for room temperature methanol oxidation also decreased.

The data clearly indicate that the interaction is not due to a charge screening effect. The smaller particles (5 nm) showed the most pronounced effect and inhibited the hybridization of complementary DNA sequences adsorbed on the Au nanoparticle surface. An experimental procedure was subsequently developed to allow the assembly of 17 and 5 nm gold nanoparticles using only single stranded DNA without the need for DNA hybridization. The assembly was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A potential pitfall in using DNA melting point analysis to infer metal nanoparticle assembly by DNA hybridization was also discovered during the development of this experimental procedure.

DNA melting point analysis showed that the oligonucleotides adsorb strongly and nonspecifically on small metal nanoparticles, inhibiting the hybridization of complementary DNA sequences in common buffered solutions. The nonspecific interaction is even strong enough to disrupt pre-existing hydrogen bonds in short double-stranded DNA. The nonspecific interaction could be weakened by increasing the particle size. As an example, a core-shell assisted method was used to successfully assemble Pt nanoparticles by DNA hybridization that could not be done otherwise.

Field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that the nanorods were about 210 nm in diameter and about 1.5 μm in length. The alternating Pt and oxophilic metal(s) segments could be easily differentiated in backscattered‐electron images. X‐ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the nanorods indicated that Pt and Ni were polycrystalline with fcc structures, Ru was hcp, and the co‐deposited RuNi adopted the nickel fcc structure with some negative shifts in the Bragg angles. The chemical states of Pt, Ru, and Ni on the nanorod surface were assayed by X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the presence of Pt0, PtII, PtIV, Ru0, RuVI, Ni0, and NiII was observed. The nanorods were catalytically active for the room‐temperature electrooxidation of methanol in acidic solutions. The relative rates of reaction showed the Pt‐RuNi pair sites as having the lowest overpotential to dissociate water, the highest catalytic activity in methanol oxidation, and the strongest CO‐tolerance in the potential window employed. The use of segmented nanorods with identifiable Pt–oxophilic metal(s) interfaces removes many of the ambiguities in the interpretation of experimental data from conventional alloy catalysts, thereby enabling a direct comparison of the activities of various types of pair sites in methanol oxidation.

Core−shell Ag−Pt nanoparticles were first obtained by the successive reduction method with a discontinuous Pt shell to allow the BSPP passage. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of the core−shell Ag−Pt nanoparticles before and after BSPP dissolution showed little changes in the particle size, indicating that the removal of the Ag cores had occurred isomorphously. The hollow Pt nanospheres, together with the predecessor Ag−Pt core−shell particles of the same size, were transferred from water to toluene and surface modified by dodecylamine in toluene. This allows the catalytic activities of solid and hollow Pt particles in room temperature methanol oxidation reaction to be compared under conditions of identical particle size and the same surface environment. The measured higher specific activity of the Pt hollow nanospheres could then be attributed unambiguously to the larger specific surface area prevalent in the porous hollow structure.

A three-component acrylic polymer blend (TCPB) consisting of a copolymer of 4-vinylphenol-methyl methacrylate, poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) and a copolymer of methyl methacrylate-ethyl acrylate is used as the methanol barrier. In order to implant a proton source phase within the membrane as homogeneously as possible, the hydrophilic monomers, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propanesulfonic acid (AMPS), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethylacrylate (PEGDMA), are polymerized only after they have been embedded in the TCPB matrix. The embedded polymerization has resulted in an asymmetric membrane structure, in which the hydrophilic network is sandwiched by two layers of matrixes with high percentages of TCPB. As expected, this asymmetric membrane structure exhibits lower methanol uptake than Nafion®117; and a proton conductivity in the range of 10−3–10−4 S/cm, which is dependent on the concentration of the sulfonic acid content. It is suggested that the two external layers in this asymmetric membrane provide primarily methanol-blocking and supporting proton-conducting properties; while the middle layer supplies protons and conserves water. This unique sandwiched PEM structure from embedded polymerization is confirmed by microstructure characterizations and by physical property measurements.

It makes use of K2BSPP to impart graduated stability to the nanoparticles in a number of NaCl solutions. The method offers a systematic approach to preparing metal nanoparticles of small diameters and a narrow size distribution from an arbitrary particle size distribution. TEM investigations confirmed the size refinement efficacy of this treatment method: in a typical experiment, the mean particle size and relative standard deviation of Au nanoparticles after three successive treatments were 5.18 and 0.055 nm, respectively, down from the corresponding values of 8.22 and 0.26 nm from the initial untreated nanoparticle solution. The K2BSPP-based size refinement procedure is a simple alternative to more complex chemical procedures and stringent process control that are currently required for the preparation of mono-dispersed systems.

In this study, experimental investigations on the nanocrystalline size of electroplated NiFe in relation to the magnetic permeability of the plated layer are conducted. The plating methods include conventional DC plating, pulse plating, and addition of saccharin in conventional DC plating and pulse plating. The plating tests are made on 60mum diameter copper wires. The wires are plated in a standard set of procedure to ensure that the composition of the plated layer matches that of the Permalloy (Ni79Fe21). The permeability of the plated material is measured by measuring the magneto-impedance of the plated wire in variation with an external magnetic field, using a precision impedance analyzer. The nanocrystalline size of the plated NiFe is measured using a XRD machine. The results show that the permeability of the plated NiFe increases with the reduction of crystalline grain size. In conventional DC plating, the FCC of the plated layer beta-Ni (Fe) crystals are in the size of 16-19 nm. It is found that the wire, which has the highest impedance ratio, is the one from pulse plating with 6 g/l of saccharin in the electrolyte solution.

The composition of the P(VDF-HFP)-g-PMMA copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and elemental analysis. X-Ray diffractometry (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to examine the reduction in crystallinity of P(VDF-HFP) due to the anchoring of PMMA segments on it. Gel electrolyte membranes based on the resulting copolymer were prepared by the Bellcore process. The ionic conductivity of Li+ across the membranes and the related transference number were measured. A study of the interfacial stability between Li electrode and the P(VDF-HFP)-g-PMMA gel electrolyte was also conducted to evaluate the suitability of the P(VDF-HFP)-g-PMMA copolymer in rechargeable lithium and lithium-ion battery applications.

It is suggested that the extent of degradation can be measured in terms of the incorporation of the hydrolysis products in the polymer matrix as evaluated by the ratio of the second anodic peak current to the first, iBiA, in the voltammogram of polyaniline (PANi) redox. The incorporation, in conjunction with partial polymer dissolution and subsequent thinning of the polymer deposit, fragmentation of PANi fibrils and extensive crosslinking, result in the densification of the polymer surface, loss of electrical conductivity and finally lead to the deactivation of the electrochemical activity. Two regions can be identified in the degradation process. In the active dissolution region, PANi is partially dissolved and a good fraction of the hydrolysis products is incorporated into the remaining film, changing both the morphology and the structure of PANi in due course. In the passivation region, the polymer is totally deactivated electrochemically as a result of the morphological modification. It is believed that degradation proceeds mainly in the surface layers of the polymer, resulting in low utilization of the polymer redox change in thick films and films deposited at high anodic deposition potentials.

We use a sample of 34,500 home sales and the population of delinquent properties for Chicago, Illinois during the period 2010 to 2013. We focus on the delinquency discount for properties within the same Census Block. We also examine the effect of delinquency duration on neighboring properties, as this measures the level of their financial distress. We estimate the magnitude of the delinquency discount using several alternative estimation methods, in each case controlling for local foreclosure activity. Our preferred method is a matching estimator, as it works to eliminate the potential for omitted variable bias that is common in this type of estimation. We find large, negative, and statistically meaningful effects of delinquent properties for which the local government has placed a tax lien and has put the lien up for sale to private investors. For properties with a tax lien that are not successfully sold, we estimate a negative spillover of 5.1% ($12,872) on surrounding properties. Properties with a tax lien that are sold to private investors have a smaller, but still negative impact on surrounding property values of 2.5% ($6310).

Using data from the pre-World War I, interwar, and post-World War II periods, for the US, Australia, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, our evidence suggests that the reduced volatility is mostly the result of calmer shocks, and less the consequence of a more stable structure. In the US, for example, we calculate that milder shocks have been responsible for around 80% of the reduction in output variability between interwar and postwar periods, while a more stable structure is responsible for the remaining 20%.

Thermal conductivity is studied using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) methods to understand the effective conductivity of a solvated CNT combined with a novel application of Hamilton–Crosser (HC) theory to estimate the conductivity of a fluid suspension of CNTs. Simulation results show how the presence of the fluid affects the CNTs ability to transport heat by disrupting the low-frequency acoustic phonons of the CNT. A spatially dependent use of the Irving–Kirkwood relations reveals the localized heat flux, illuminating the heat transfer pathways in the composite material. Model results can be consistently incorporated into HC theory by considering ensembles of CNTs and their surrounding fluid as being present in the liquid. The simulation-informed theory is shown to be consistent with existing experimental results.	Heat transfer enhancement, Micro heat transfer, Nanoscale heat transfer	2015-07-01 00:00:00

A 3D deterministic hydrodynamic model is developed to provide daily water quality forecasting for eight marine beaches in Tsuen Wan, which are only about 8 km from the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS) outfall discharging 1.4 million m3/d of partially-treated sewage. The fate and transport of the HATS effluent and its impact on the E. coli level at nearby beaches are studied. The model features the seamless coupling of near field jet mixing and the far field transport and dispersion of wastewater discharge from submarine outfalls, and a spatial–temporal dependent E. coli decay rate formulation specifically developed for sub-tropical Hong Kong waters. The model prediction of beach water quality has been extensively validated against field data both before and after disinfection of the HATS effluent. Compared with daily beach E. coli data during August–November 2011, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 81–91% in forecasting compliance/exceedance of beach water quality standard. The 3D deterministic model has been most valuable in the interpretation of the complex variation of beach water quality which depends on tidal level, solar radiation and other hydro-meteorological factors. The model can also be used in optimization of disinfection dosage and in emergency response situations.

Lee	Daily prediction of marine beach water quality in Hong Kong	Journal of Hydro-environment Research	Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China	hreclhw@hku.hk;jhwlee@ust.hk	Bacterial concentration (Escherichia coli) is generally adopted as a key indicator of beach water quality. Currently the beach management system in Hong Kong relies on past water quality data sampled at intervals between 3 and 14 days. Beach advisories are issued when the geometric mean E. coli level of the past five samples exceeds the beach water quality objective (WQO) of 180 counts/100 mL. When the E. coli level varies dynamically, the system is not able to track the daily bacterial variation. And yet worldwide there does not exist a generally accepted method to predict beach water quality in a marine environment, which is influenced by hydro-meteorological variables, catchment characteristics, as well as complicated tidal currents and wave effects. A comprehensive study of beach water quality prediction has been carried out for four representative beaches in Hong Kong: Big Wave Bay (BW), Deep Water Bay (DW), New Cafeteria (NC) and Silvermine Bay (SIL). Statistical analysis of the extensive regular monitoring data was carried out for two periods before and after the commissioning of the Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS): (1990–1997) and (2002–2006) respectively. The data analysis shows that E. coli is strongly correlated with seven hydro-environmental variables: rainfall, solar radiation, wind speed, tide level, salinity, water temperature and past E. coli concentration. The relative importance of the parameters is beach-specific, and depends on the local geographical and hydrographical characteristics as well as location of nearby pollution sources. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are developed from the sparsely sampled regular monitoring data (2002–2006) to predict the next-day E. coli concentration using the key hydro-environmental variables as input parameters. The models are validated against daily monitoring data in the bathing seasons of 2007 and 2008. The models are able to track the dynamic changes in E. coli concentration and predict WQO compliance/exceedance with an overall accuracy of 70–96%. Both the MLR and ANN models are superior to the current beach advisories in capturing water quality variations, and in predicting WQO exceedances. For example, the models predict around 80% and 50% of the exceedances at BW and NC respectively in June–July 2007, as compared to 0% and 14% based purely on past data. Similarly, observed exceedances are predicted with success rates of 71%, 42%, and 53% at BW, NC, and SIL respectively during July–October 2008, as compared with 0%, 0%, and 6% using the current water quality assessment criterion. The MLR and ANN models have similar performances; ANN model tends to be better in predicting the high-end concentrations, with however a greater number of false positive predictions (false alarms). This work demonstrates the practical feasibility of predicting bacterial concentration based on the critical hydro-environmental variables, and paves the way for developing a real time water quality forecast and management system for Hong Kong.

Field measurements show that the water quality in the upper and middle reaches is generally good and well exceeds the drinking quality standard, with high bio-diversity. The streamflow of the East River Basin is satisfactorily simulated using both the distributed MIKE-SHE model and the lumped HSPF model. With an average streamflow of 760 m3/s, the River is able to satisfy the current water demand. Using the HSPF model, the water quality is found to have deteriorated in recent years. In addition to water supply, the River also supports a variety of needs such as hydro-power generation, waste assimilation, navigation, habitat for aquatic life, and expulsion of sea water intrusion. Using the projected need of 150 m3/s for water supply, the instream flow requirement based on hydrological and water quality simulation is estimated to be 467 m3/s in 2010. This suggests that the water sustainability of the East River requires alternative strategies, which may include integrated water resources management, provision of better wastewater treatment, and water and soil conservation.

Lee	Numerical determination of flushing time for stratified water bodies	Journal of Marine Systems	Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China	hreclhw@hkucc.hku.hk	It is often advantageous to model a semi-enclosed estuarine or coastal embayment (e.g. fish farms or tidal inlets, or typhoon shelters) as a separate system within a larger water body connected to the outer sea. The water quality of the system depends crucially on its flushing time—the average time of a particle in the system. The flushing time is governed by the barotropic and baroclinic tidal exchanges between the system and the outer sea. We describe herein a general method to determine systematically the flushing time of a stratified water body via a numerical tracer experiment. Numerical solution of the 3D flow and mass transport equations for many practical problems show that the tracer mass removal process depends on the physical topography and bathymetry, tidal range and the degree of stratification in the outer sea. Field application suggests that the tracer mass variation can be well approximated by a double-exponential decay curve that can be described by three flushing coefficients. Using a simple analytical two-segment model, the flushing coefficients can be given a clear physical interpretation, and the flushing time can be easily determined in terms of the coefficients. The method is illustrated by application to a number of tidal inlets in Hong Kong, in both the dry and wet season. The connection between the numerically determined flushing time and the traditional bulk flushing time obtained from salt-balance methods is established.

Lee;K W Choi;Feleke Arega	Environmental management of marine fish culture in Hong Kong	Marine Pollution Bulletin	Department of Civil Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China	hreclhw@hkucc.hku.hk	Marine fish farming is an important commercial practice in Hong Kong. Marine fish farms located in eutrophic coastal waters often face the threat of severe dissolved oxygen depletion associated with algal blooms and red tides. On the other hand, mariculture activities also contribute to pollution. The sustainable management of mariculture requires proper siting of the fish farms and stocking density control. Both of these are related to the carrying capacity of the water body concerned, which is mainly governed by its flushing characteristics. A simple method to determine the carrying capacity of a fish farm has been developed by using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modelling and its effective coupling with a diagenetic water quality model. A systematic methodology using numerical tracer experiments has been developed to compute the tidal flushing in a fish farm. The flushing time is determined from the results of a numerical tracer experiment using robust 3D hydrodynamic and mass transport models. A unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the region of interest and zero elsewhere; the subsequent mass transport and the mass removal process are then tracked. The fish farms are usually situated in well-sheltered shallow embayments and may not connect directly to the open water. It is found that it is necessary to define both “local” and “system-wide” flushing times to represent the effectiveness of the mass exchange with the surrounding water body and the open sea respectively. A diagenetic water quality model simulating the sediment–water–pollutant interaction is employed to address the response of the water column and the benthic layer to pollution discharges. With the flushing rate reliably computed, the carrying capacity of the fish farm can be determined in terms of key water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, organic nitrogen and potential lowest dissolved oxygen level on a day of negligible photosynthetic production. The predictions are well-supported by field data.

To uncover new transcription factors that would determine clinical outcomes in breast cancer, we systematically analyzed gene expression data from breast cancer patients. Our results revealed that Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) is the top-ranked survival-associated transcription factor in patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Surprisingly, silencing FOXM1 expression led breast cancer cells to become more sensitive to doxorubicin (Dox). We found that FOXM1-dependent resistance to Dox is mediated by regulating DNA repair genes. We further demonstrated that NFκB1 interacts with FOXM1 in the presence of Dox to protect breast cancer cells from DNA damage. Finally, silencing FOXM1 expression in breast cancer cells in a mouse xenograft model significantly sensitized the cells to Dox.

Because of the hundreds or thousands of genomic/epigenomic alterations that have accumulated in the cancer genome, it is very challenging to find and test candidate genes driving tumor development and progression. Systematic studies of the liver cancer genome have become available in recent years. These studies have uncovered new potential driver genes, including those not previously known to be involved in the development of liver cancer. Novel approaches combining multiple datasets from patient tissues have created an unparalleled opportunity to uncover potential new therapeutic targets and prognostic/predictive biomarkers for personalized therapy that can improve clinical outcomes of the patients with liver cancer.	gene expression profiling, liver neoplasms, oligonucleotide array sequence analysis	2013-12-01 00:00:00

However, it is uncertain as to what extent the mouse models reproduce the corresponding cancers in humans. We have compared the global gene expression patterns in human and mouse hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in an attempt to identify the mouse models that most extensively reproduce the molecular pathways in the human tumors. The comparative analysis of the gene expression patterns in murine and human HCC indicates that certain genetic mouse models closely reproduce the gene expression patterns of HCC in humans, while others do not. Identification of mouse models that reproduce the molecular features of specific human cancers (or subclasses of specific human cancers) promises to accelerate both the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of cancer and the discovery of therapeutic targets. We propose that this method, comparative functional genomics, could be effectively applied to the analysis of mouse models for other human cancers.

Currently, surface defect detection of solar cells can be achieved by several approaches such as machine vision, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence imaging techniques. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to inspect the inner structures of solar cells. In response to this need, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have become common techniques for investigating the nanostructures of solar cells. However, both carry the disadvantages of destructive imaging, high cost, and a small inspection area. Moreover, it is difficult to simultaneously estimate multiple optical properties with the aforementioned techniques. In this study, we propose the use of phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) for the inspection of solar cells. We develop a two-reference-arm configuration to reduce the phase noise that intrinsically accompanies the OCT system. Based on the proposed approach to extract the amplitude and phase terms from OCT interference signals, the 3D microstructure of solar cells can be obtained while simultaneously probing the nanostructures on arbitrary planes of the solar cell. The OCT microstructural results show that the structures of different layers can be nondestructively visualized and quantitatively evaluated. From the phase signal, the inverted pyramid structure, which is commonly used for the reduction of interface reflection, can be visualized. Moreover, based on the two-reference-arm configuration, the optical reflection coefficient (ORC) can be estimated in order to evaluate the interface reflection from the surface of solar cell. Results show that PS-OCT can be a valuable tool for providing nondestructive inspection of the micro/nanostructures of solar cells.

The high performance of this AR coating is due to the realization of a smooth gradient profile of refractive index fabricated by only two physical layers. First, due to the inherent inhomogeneous-nanoporous geometry along the surface normal, the ZnO NRs are reasonable to be considered as discrete multiple optical layers with low scattering loss, leading to the index smoothly increasing from air ambient toward down to the solar cells. Second, to compensate the gap of index between ZnO and solar cells, an additional TiO2 layer with index in between is hence necessary to insert under ZnO NRs, significantly further reducing the Fresnel reflection loss of the entire device. The ZnO NRs/ TiO2 layer shows a low wavelength-averaged (solar spectrum weighted) reflectance of 6.00% (4.78%) over a wide spectral range of λ=380–1800 nm, and exhibits a hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 128.2°. At device level, we compared the photovoltaic performance of solar cells with and without AR coating, the short-circuit density (JSC) is enhanced by 31.8% and 23.8% for solar cells integrated with the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer and conventional SiO2/TiO2 double-layer AR (DLAR) coating, respectively. Under a very large incident angle of solar illumination (θ=80°), the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer remains static with JSC enhancement of 35.2%, whereas the JSC enhancement of conventional DLAR coating drops down to 9.4%. In addition, the ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer barely affects the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar device. Therefore, the proposed ZnO NRs/TiO2 layer with a smoother graded refractive index change is highly promising for the AR coating applications for the next-generation solar cells.

The fundamental concept is to grade the Al composition of the barrier layer from GaN to AlxGa1−xN, thereby alleviating the impact of piezoelectric polarization on the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) and establishing a conduction-band profile well above the Fermi energy. These effects lead to a positive shift in the threshold voltage of the device and benefit the normally-off operation. It is observed that the device’s DC transfer characteristics can be further modulated simply by adjusting the Al composition of the AlyGa1−yN cap layer and the p-type doping concentration at the top of the GaN buffer layer. These findings, based on a physical simulation of the proposed device, provide a guideline for the implementation of highly efficient, normally-off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.

The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) active layer and the light extraction efficiency of the LED structure were enhanced by forming this nanotips structure to serve as a graded-refractive index layer, which is further validated by the finite-difference time-domain analysis. The PL emission peak of the MQWs active layer has a blue-shift phenomenon that is caused by a partial reduction of the strain on the InGaN well. It is expected that our approach opens a promising route for simultaneously enhancing both the internal quantum efficiency and the light extraction efficiency of GaN-based LEDs. The proposed AFM-based method will be of importance for local patterning the light emitting components for optoelectronic applications.	atomic force microscopy,light extraction efficiency,nanotips	2014-04-01 00:00:00

Compared to conventional solar cells grown on a planar sapphire substrate, threading dislocation defects were found to be reduced from 1.28 × 109 to 3.62 × 108 cm−2, leading to an increase in short-circuit current density (JSC = 1.09 mA·cm−2) of approximately 60%. In addition, the open-circuit voltage and fill factor (VOC = 2.05 V; FF = 51%) of the solar cells grown on PSS were nearly identical to those of conventional devices. The enhanced performance is primarily due to improvements in the crystalline quality of the epitaxial layers, reducing the trapping of photogenerated electrons and holes by nonradiative recombination centers in MQW, with a corresponding increase in the transport efficiency of the carriers outside the device.	gallium compounds; III-V semiconductors; indium compounds; semiconductor epitaxial layers; semiconductor quantum wells; short-circuit currents; solar cells; Quantum well devices; Quantum wells	2011-06-01 00:00:00

The light output power of the PSS LED was 1.15 times higher than that of the conventional LED at an injection current of 20 mA. The output power and external quantum efficiency were estimated to be 9 mW and 16.4%, respectively.

In addition, guided by principles under expectancy-value theory, the study sought to determine the extent to which patterns of growth differed by motivation (self-efficacy and valuing) and socio-educational attributes (gender, language background, and achievement). The sample comprised 194 students from four schools who participated in three rounds of data collection across five academic years of their schooling, spanning middle school and high school. In the main, mathematics aspirations declined over time while mathematics disengagement increased. However, initial levels of aspirations and disengagement and their rates of change over time were impacted by motivational and socio-educational factors.

Whereas the bulk of research investigating H-I and medication has focused on students (conducting student-level analyses), research into classroom climates and processes suggests this issue be examined at both student- and classroom-levels. The sample comprised 54,165 Australian students (from 5419 classrooms) for whom H-I data were available in kindergarten and achievement data were available in year 3 and year 5. In preliminary variance components analyses, findings showed there was notable variation in H-I and psychostimulant status from classroom to classroom. In multilevel path analysis, at both student- and class-levels psychostimulants reduced the negative effects of H-I on student achievement, to a level where H-I had no significant negative impact on achievement. These effects were not moderated by dosage or psychostimulant type. Taken together, our findings add to the body of effective multi-modal educational and psychological interventions used to enhance the achievement outcomes of individual students who present with ADHD and—of particular note and novelty in this study—the classrooms to which they belong.

Study 1 used cross-sectional data and employed structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the role of growth goals in mediating the link between interpersonal relationships and academic engagement.

Study 3 used longitudinal data and SEM to test a cross-lagged panel design to investigate reciprocal links between growth goals and growth mindset. Study 4 conducted multi-level SEM where the effects of a growth orientation on engagement and achievement were investigated at the student-level (level 1) and the classroom-level (level 2). Taking these four studies together, we aim to show how correlational data and multivariate correlational analyses have been effective in answering research questions in a way that have practical and theoretical implications for students’ academic growth. We also position this review as a substantive-methodological synergy – an approach recently recommended in response to concerns about the increasing polarization of substantive and methodological research and researchers.

The aim of this study was to evaluate selected items in the management of patients with STS, comparing results between RC and local hospitals (LHs). Diagnostic and therapeutic data from patients diagnosed between January 2004 and December 2011 were collected. Correlation with outcome was performed. A total of 622 sarcomas were analyzed, with a median follow-up of 40 months. Imaging of primary tumor preoperatively (yes vs. no) correlated with a higher probability of free surgical margins (77.4% versus 53.7%; p = .006). The provenance of the biopsy (RC vs. LH) significantly affected relapse-free survival (RFS; 3-year RFS 66% vs. 46%, respectively; p = .019). Likewise, 3-year RFS was significantly worse in cases with infiltrated (55.6%) or unknown (43.4%) microscopic surgical margins compared with free margins (63.6%; p < .001). Patients managed by RCs had a better 3-year overall survival compared with those managed by LHs (82% vs. 70.4%, respectively; p = .003). Perioperative chemotherapy in high-risk STS, more frequently administered in RCs than in LHs, resulted in significantly better 3-year RFS (66% vs. 44%; p = .011). In addition, patients with stage IV disease treated in RCs survived significantly longer compared with those in LHs (30.4 months vs. 18.5 months; p = .036). Our series indicate that selected quality-of-care items were accomplished better by RCs over LHs, all with significant prognostic value in patients with STS. Early referral to an RC should be mandatory if the aim is to improve the survival of patients with STS.

Surgery is recommended for uterine leiomyosarcoma, with trabectedin being the preferred option for advanced disease when the treatment goal is long-term tumor stabilization. Liposarcoma subgroups are characterized by distinctive morphologies and genetics, different patterns of disease progression and clinical behavior, and variable responses to treatment. Genetic analysis of sarcomas has provided insights into pathogenesis with potential for developing new molecular targets. At the cytogenetic level, soft tissue sarcomas are categorized into specific, balanced translocations and those due to massive chromosomal rearrangements. For subtypes such as undifferentiated sarcomas, angiosarcomas, alveolar soft part sarcomas and clear cell sarcomas, evidence is especially limited, although it is known that these tumors display markedly different sensitivities to chemotherapeutic and targeted agents.	alveolar soft part sarcoma,angiosarcoma,clear cell sarcoma,liposarcoma,translocation-related sarcomas,undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,uterine leiomyosarcoma	2018-05-01 00:00:00

Also, KIT expression may be post-transcriptionally regulated by miRNA221 and miRNA222. Hence, the aim of this study is to characterize KNGL population, by differential gene expression, and to analyze miRNA221/222 expression and their prognostic value in KNGL patients. KIT, PDGFRA, DOG1, IGF1R, MIR221 and MIR222 expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. We also analyzed KIT and PDGFRA mutations, DOG1 expression, by immunohistochemistry, along with clinical and pathological data. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) differences were calculated using Log-rank test. Hierarchical cluster analyses from gene expression data identified two groups: group I had KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA overexpression and IGF1R underexpression and group II had overexpression of IGF1R and low expression of KIT, DOG1 and PDGFRA. Group II had a significant worse OS (p = 0.013) in all the series, and showed a tendency for worse OS (p = 0.11), when analyzed only the localized cases. MiRNA222 expression was significantly lower in a control subset of KIT-positive GIST (p < 0.001). OS was significantly worse in KNGL cases with higher expression of MIR221 (p = 0.028) or MIR222 (p = 0.014). We identified two distinct KNGL subsets, with a different prognostic value. Increased levels of miRNA221/222, which are associated with worse OS, could explain the absence of KIT protein expression of most KNGL tumors.

While considerable information is available on the SVZ-OB neural stem cell (NSC)/neuroprogenitor cell (NPC) niche in rodents, less work has been done on this system in large animals. The newborn piglet is used as a preclinical translational model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, but information about the endogenous sources of NSCs/NPCs in piglet is needed to implement endogenous or autologous cell-based therapies in this model. We characterized NSC/NPC niches in piglet forebrain and OB-SVZ using western blotting, histological, and cell culture methods. Immunoblotting revealed nestin, a NSC/NPC marker, in forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ in newborn piglet. Several progenitor or newborn neuron markers, including Dlx2, musashi, doublecortin, and polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule were also detected in OB-SVZ by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of nestin, musashi, and doublecortin in forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling showed that the forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ accumulate newly replicated cells. BrdU-positive cells were immunolabeled for astroglial, oligodendroglial, and neuronal markers. A lateral migratory pathway for newly born neuron migration to primary olfactory cortex was revealed by BrdU labeling and co-labeling for doublecortin and class III β tubulin. Isolated and cultured forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ cells from newborn piglet had the capacity to generate numerous neurospheres. Single cell clonal analysis of neurospheres revealed the capacity for self-renewal and multipotency. Neurosphere-derived cells differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and were amenable to permanent genetic tagging with lentivirus encoding green fluorescent protein. We conclude that the piglet OB-SVZ is a reservoir of NSCs and NPCs suitable to use in autologous cell therapy in preclinical models of neonatal/pediatric brain injury.

Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases have been linked to mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, but it is unclear how mutations in the protein result in motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic (tg) mice expressing mutated forms of human SOD1 (hSOD1) develop clinical and pathological features similar to those of ALS. We used tg mice expressing hSOD1-G93A, hSOD1-G37R, and hSOD1-wild-type to investigate a new subcellular pathology involving mutant hSOD1 protein prominently localizing to the nuclear compartment and disruption of the architecture of nuclear gems. We developed methods for extracting relatively pure cell nucleus fractions from mouse CNS tissues and demonstrate a low nuclear presence of endogenous SOD1 in mouse brain and spinal cord, but prominent nuclear accumulation of hSOD1-G93A, -G37R, and -wild-type in tg mice. The hSOD1 concentrated in the nuclei of spinal cord cells, particularly motor neurons, at a young age. The survival motor neuron protein (SMN) complex is disrupted in motor neuron nuclei before disease onset in hSOD1-G93A and -G37R mice; age-matched hSOD1-wild-type mice did not show SMN disruption despite a nuclear presence. Our data suggest new mechanisms involving hSOD1 accumulation in the cell nucleus and mutant hSOD1-specific perturbations in SMN localization with disruption of the nuclear SMN complex in ALS mice and suggest an overlap of pathogenic mechanisms with spinal muscular atrophy.

They are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. Some forms of PD and ALS are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. Morphological, biochemical, and genetic, as well as cell and animal model, studies reveal that mitochondria could have a role in this neurodegeneration. The functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations. In PD, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. Transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This review will present how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neurodegeneration in PD and ALS and could serve as a target for drug therapy.

Familial forms of ALS are linked to mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. The mechanisms of human SOD1 (hSOD1) toxicity to MNs are unknown. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle is a primary site of pathogenesis in ALS that triggers MN degeneration. We created transgenic (tg) mice expressing wild-type-, G37R- and G93A-hSOD1 gene variants only in skeletal muscle. These tg mice developed age-related neurologic and pathologic phenotypes consistent with ALS. Affected mice showed limb weakness and paresis with motor deficits. Skeletal muscles developed severe pathology involving oxidative damage, protein nitration, myofiber cell death and marked neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities. Spinal MNs developed distal axonopathy and formed ubiquitinated inclusions and degenerated through an apoptotic-like pathway involving capsase-3. Mice expressing wild-type and mutant forms of hSOD1 developed MN pathology. These results demonstrate that human SOD1 in skeletal muscle has a causal role in ALS and identify a new non-autonomous mechanism for MN degeneration explaining their selective vulnerability. The discovery of instigating molecular toxicities or disease progression determinants within skeletal muscle could be very valuable for the development of new effective therapies for the treatment and cure of ALS.	motor neurons,skeletal muscles,mice,sod1 gene,tissue degeneration	2010-03-01 00:00:00

Morphological, biochemical, molecular genetic, and cell/animal model studies suggest that mitochondria have potentially diverse roles in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and neuronal cell death. In human ALS, abnormalities have been found in mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, and mitochondrial cell death proteins indicative of some non-classical form of programmed cell death. Mouse models of ALS are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria. This minireview summarizes work on the how malfunctioning mitochondria might contribute to neuronal death in ALS through the biophysical entity called the mitochondrial permeability pore (mPTP). The major protein components of the mPTP are enriched in mouse motor neurons. Early in the course of disease in ALS mice expressing human mutant superoxide dismutase-1, mitochondria in motor neurons undergo trafficking abnormalities and dramatic remodeling resulting in the formation of mega-mitochondria and coinciding with increased protein carbonyl formation and nitration of mPTP components. The genetic deletion of a major mPTP component, cyclophilin D, has robust effects in ALS mice by delaying disease onset and extending survival. Thus, attention should be directed to the mPTP as a rational target for the development of drugs designed to treat ALS.

However, most data reveal only associations, and the role for DNA damage in direct mechanisms of neurodegeneration is vague with respect to being a definitive upstream cause of neuron cell death, rather than a consequence of the degeneration. Although neurons seem inclined to develop DNA damage during oxidative stress, most of the existing work on DNA damage and repair mechanisms has been done in the context of cancer biology using cycling nonneuronal cells but not nondividing (i.e. postmitotic) neurons. Nevertheless, the identification of mutations in genes that encode proteins that function in DNA repair and DNA damage response in human hereditary DNA repair deficiency syndromes and ataxic disorders is establishing a mechanistic precedent that clearly links DNA damage and DNA repair abnormalities with progressive neurodegeneration. This review summarizes DNA damage and repair mechanisms and their potential relevance to the evolution of degeneration in postmitotic neurons.

In PD, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified recently and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in nigral neurons. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and in mitochondrial cell death proteins, indicative of an activation of programmed cell death pathways.

We assessed the hypothesis that measurements of protein levels in injured brain determined by an isotopic assay using [125I]–protein A have greater reliability than those made by conventional immunoperoxidase labeling using diaminobenzidine. Quantification of immunoreactivities for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) was determined by optical density signal in the immunoisotopic and immunoperoxidase assays. In ischemic brain, the immunoisotopic assay detected protein increases (cortical penumbra HSP-70, 151 ± 6%), protein decreases (cortical ischemic core GLT-1, 61 ± 6%) and no changes in GFAP levels compared to controls animals. These results differed from the protein levels found by the immunoperoxidase assay, which showed elevated HSP-70, GLT-1 and GFAP in all ischemic regions. We conclude that nonspecific immunosignal confounds assessments of protein expression in injured brain and that the immunoisotopic method is a valid approach to regionally localize and quantify proteins after brain injury. The disadvantage of the falsely positive overestimation of protein immunoreactivity after stroke with the immunoperoxidase method has to be weighted with the advantage of the cellular resolution.

Demographic details, scene information and post-mortem findings were obtained from medico-legal case files concerning non-viable fetuses, stillbirths and concealment of birth cases admitted to SRM between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2016 (n = 249). Despite the majority of the cases being natural deaths, the cause of death frequently remained ‘undetermined’ in these cases, often due to the presence of decomposition. Histological analyses were only performed in a small fraction of undetermined cases. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the prosecution rate of abandoned live births is extremely low was supported by this study, with only one case prosecuted in the 5-year period. For the remainder of the cases, the court status was given as either ‘under investigation’ (47.8%) or ‘case closed’ (47.8%). In the majority of the instances, the case was closed due to the unknown identity of the biological mother; however, DNA analyses were not performed in all of these cases. Overall, the data highlighted the need for the development and implementation of standard protocols, and recommendations were made for conducting the medico-legal investigation of abandoned neonates in a South African setting.

This is of particular concern in developing countries where poor-socio economic status and a lack of healthcare resources contribute to the high burden of disease. In some cases death due to infection can be acute and aggressive, and death may occur without a diagnosis whilst the person is still alive. These deaths may ultimately lead to a medico-legal autopsy being performed. There are various mechanisms by which sudden death due to infection may occur. In addition, there are many risk factors associated with sudden death due to infection, which differ between infants and older individuals. However, it is unclear which pathogens and risk factors are most frequently associated with sudden death due to infection. Therefore a systematic review of articles and case reports published between 1 January 2000 and 30 June 2016 was undertaken in order to (1) explore the relationship between pathogens and their causative role and (2) identify the relationship between predisposing and/or risk factors associated with sudden death due to infection. Major databases were searched and after critical appraisal 143 articles were identified. It was found that respiratory infections and deaths involving bacterial pathogens were most commonly associated with these deaths. In addition the most common risk factors in infants were exposure to tobacco smoke and co-sleeping. In adults the most common risk factors were co-morbid conditions and illnesses. This information aids in a better understanding of these deaths and highlights the need for more research in this field, particularly in developing countries	SUDA,SUDI,Medico-legal investigation,Risk factors,Infection-related death	2018-05-01 00:00:00

Expected energy loads, transportation, and storage as well as user behavior influence the quantity and quality of the energy consumed daily in buildings. However, technology is now available that can accurately monitor, collect, and store the huge amount of data involved in this process. Furthermore, this technology is capable of analyzing and exploiting such data in meaningful ways. Not surprisingly, the use of data science techniques to increase energy efficiency is currently attracting a great deal of attention and interest. This paper reviews how Data Science has been applied to address the most difficult problems faced by practitioners in the field of Energy Management, especially in the building sector. The work also discusses the challenges and opportunities that will arise with the advent of fully connected devices and new computational technologies.

However, raw data may not always be available, it can be distributed in multiple datasets and therefore there resulting number of association rules to be inspected is overwhelming. In the light of these observations, we propose meta-association rules, a new framework for mining association rules over previously discovered rules in multiple databases. Meta-association rules are a new tool that convey new information from the patterns extracted from multiple datasets and give a “summarized” representation about most frequent patterns. We propose and compare two different algorithms based respectively on crisp rules and fuzzy rules, concluding that fuzzy meta-association rules are suitable to incorporate to the meta-mining procedure the obtained quality assessment provided by the rules in the first step of the process, although it consumes more time than the crisp approach. In addition, fuzzy meta-rules give a more manageable set of rules for its posterior analysis and they allow the use of fuzzy items to express additional knowledge about the original databases. The proposed framework is illustrated with real-life data about crime incidents in the city of Chicago. Issues such as the difference with traditional approaches are discussed using synthetic data.

Open standards, such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), have contributed to expand its adoption, but they have limited capabilities for cross-domain information integration and query. To address these challenges, the Linked Building Data initiative promotes the use of ontologies and Semantic Web technologies in order to create more formal and interoperable BIMs. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based extension of such semantic BIMs that provides support for imprecise knowledge representation and retrieval. We propose an expressive fuzzy ontology language, and describe how to use a fuzzy reasoning engine in a BIM context with selected examples. The resulting fuzzy semantic BIM enables new functionalities in the project design and analysis stages—namely, soft integration of cross-domain knowledge, flexible BIM query, and imprecise parametric modeling.

Consequently, they are increasing their system innovation investments to turn information into useful knowledge for decision making obtained from heterogeneous Knowledge Sources (KSOs) such as databases, documents, and even ontologies. Methodological Resources (MRs) for the required knowledge discovering and recovering purposes have gradually become more elaborated and mature in the framework of Knowledge Engineering. Particularly, in the Ontology Learning (OL) field, there is a lack of integrated and open methodologies that could involve all the optional KSOs. In this sense, a systemic perspective is introduced combining MRs associated to diverse KSOs to improve the quality of an integral and continuous Knowledge Acquisition (KA) process. The main contributions provided by this work are on one hand, a novel Systemic Methodology for OL (SMOL) from heterogeneous KSOs which is applied for a case study and on the other hand, an evaluation of SMOL.

Despite the existence of several approaches that point in this direction, simplifying integration and interoperability among users, suppliers and the enterprise during product lifecycle, is still an open issue. Ontologies have been used in some manufacturing applications and they promise to be a valid approach to model manufacturing resources of enterprises (e.g. machinery and raw material). Nevertheless, in this domain, most of the ontologies have been developed following methodologies based on development from scratch, thus ontologies previously developed have been discarded. Such ontological methodologies tend to hold the interoperability issues in some level. In this paper, a method that integrates ontology reuse with ontology validation and learning is presented. An upper (top-level) ontology for manufacturing was used as a reference to evaluate and to improve specific domain ontology. The evaluation procedure was based on the systemic methodology for ontology learning (SMOL). As a result of the application of SMOL, an ontology entitled Machine of a Process (MOP) was developed. The terminology included in MOP was validated by means of a text mining procedure called Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) which was carried out on documents from the domain in this study. Competency questions were performed on preexisting domain ontologies and MOP, proving that this new ontology has a performance better than the domain ontologies used as seed.

Such optional engineering strategies consider that some systems, such as the Knowledge Support System (KSS) fulfill the needs of the knowledge user, by providing the services and management qualities they require. Some key features of the KSS have been analyzed to identify their main characteristics or system components according to the most recent trends. Lately, some solutions have been proposed to develop this type of knowledge system based on the approaches, Ontology Development and Ontology Learning (OL). In this paper, a novel model of an Ontology-Learning Knowledge Support System (OLeKSS) is proposed to keep these KSSs updated. The proposal applies concepts and methodologies of system modeling as well as a wide selection of OL processes from heterogeneous knowledge sources (ontologies, texts, and databases), in order to improve KSS’s semantic product through a process of periodic knowledge updating. An application of a Systemic Methodology for OL (SMOL) in an academic Case Study illustrates the enhancement of the associated ontologies through process of population and enrichment.

Martin-Bautista	On the quest for easy-to-understand splitting rules	Data & Knowledge Engineering	Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence University of Granada, Spain	mbautis@decsai.ugr.es	Decision trees are probably the most popular and commonly used classification model. They are built recursively following a top-down approach (from general concepts to particular examples) by repeated splits of the training dataset. The chosen splitting criterion may affect the accuracy of the classifier, but not significantly. In fact, none of the proposed splitting criteria in the literature has proved to be universally better than the rest. Although they all yield similar results, their complexity varies significantly, and they are not always suitable for multi-way decision trees. Here we propose two new splitting rules which obtain similar results to other well-known criteria when used to build multi-way decision trees, while their simplicity makes them ideal for non-expert users.

A first query is made to the web and an initial set of documents is retrieved. Considering the terms of the collection as items, text transactions are constructed and association rules are extracted. Fuzzy association rules are also considered when the presence of an item in a transaction is a weight between zero and one. A selection of the best rules is carried out and the terms in those rules are offered to the user to refine the query.	: information retrieval, association rules, fuzzy logic, query refinement	2003-01-01 00:00:00

ICEIS	Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence University of Granada, Spain;Research Centre for Information and Communications Technologies (CITIC-UGR), Spain	mbautis@decsai.ugr.es	We present two different models to aggregate document evaluations and user profiles in the field of Information Retrieval. The main aim of this work is to discuss a general methodology to establish the most relevant terms in order to characterize a given “topic” on an Information Retrieval System. The starting point is a collection of documents from which a set of characteristic terms is selected. The presence of a term in a document is known and we want to establish the most significant ones in order to select “relevant” documents about a given “topic” Π. For that purpose, a group of experts is required to assess the set of documents. By aggregating these assessments with the presence-weight of terms, a measurement of their relevance in relation with Π may be obtained. The two presented models differ in that experts can query with the same terms (an unique query) to the system or with different terms (several queries). An overview of these situations and a general methodology to cope with them for our model is presented here	Information Retrieval, User Profiles, Linguistic Approach, Ordinal Assessment, Aggregation Operators	2003-01-01 00:00:00

Amparo Vila	A probabilistic definition of a nonconvex fuzzy cardinality	Fuzzy Sets and Systems	Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence University of Granada, Spain	mbautis@decsai.ugr.es	The existing methods to assess the cardinality of a fuzzy set with finite support are intended to preserve the properties of classical cardinality. In particular, the main objective of researchers in this area has been to ensure the convexity of fuzzy cardinalities, in order to preserve some properties based on the addition of cardinalities, such as the additivity property. We have found that in order to solve many real-world problems, such as the induction of fuzzy rules in Data Mining, convex cardinalities are not always appropriate. In this paper, we propose a possibilistic and a probabilistic cardinality of a fuzzy set with finite support. These cardinalities are not convex in general, but they are most suitable for solving problems and, contrary to the generalizing opinion, they are found to be more intuitive for humans. Their suitability relies mainly on the fact that they assume dependency among objects with respect to the property “to be in a fuzzy set”. The cardinality measures are generalized to relative ones among pairs of fuzzy sets. We also introduce a definition of the entropy of a fuzzy set by using one of our probabilistic measures. Finally, a fuzzy ranking of the cardinality of fuzzy sets is proposed, and a definition of graded equipotency is introduced.

Vaccine	Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom;National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, China	martin.maiden@zoo.ox.ac.uk	The eradication of infectious agents is an attractive means of disease control that, to date, has been achieved for only one human pathogen, the smallpox virus. The introduction of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis into immunisation schedules, and particularly the conjugate polysaccharide vaccines which can interrupt transmission, raises the question of whether disease caused by this obligate human bacterium can be controlled, eliminated, or even eradicated. The limited number of meningococcal serogroups, lack of an animal reservoir, and importance of meningococcal disease are considerations in favour of eradication; however, the commensal nature of most infections, the high diversity of meningococcal populations, and the lack of comprehensive vaccines are all factors that suggest that this is not feasible. Indeed, any such attempt might be harmful by perturbing the human microbiome and its interaction with the immune system. On balance, the control and possible elimination of disease caused by particular disease-associated meningococcal genotypes is a more achievable and worthwhile goal.

The hyperinvasive ST-11 clonal complex (cc11) caused serogroup C (MenC) outbreaks in the US military in the 1960s and UK universities in the 1990s, a global Hajj-associated serogroup W (MenW) outbreak in 2000–2001, and subsequent MenW epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. More recently, endemic MenW disease has expanded in South Africa, South America and the UK, and MenC cases have been reported among European and North American men who have sex with men (MSM). Routine typing schemes poorly resolve cc11 so we established the population structure at genomic resolution. Representatives of these episodes and other geo-temporally diverse cc11 meningococci (n = 750) were compared across 1546 core genes and visualised on phylogenetic networks. MenW isolates were confined to a distal portion of one of two main lineages with MenB and MenC isolates interspersed elsewhere. An expanding South American/UK MenW strain was distinct from the ‘Hajj outbreak’ strain and a closely related endemic South African strain. Recent MenC isolates from MSM in France and the UK were closely related but distinct. High resolution ‘genomic’ multilocus sequence typing is necessary to resolve and monitor the spread of diverse cc11 lineages globally.

Recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have permitted whole-genome sequencing of a wide variety of bacterial species and facilitated the development of genome-wide expanded MLST schemes. This chapter describes a flexible, scalable and hierarchical gene-by-gene approach to bacterial classification and population analyses, based on the concept of seven-locus MLST. Furthermore, the approach is both backwards and forwards compatible since 16S rRNA and seven-locus MLST information can be extracted and compared with original Sanger sequence data and the databases employed can accommodate sequence data from any source. The gene-by-gene approach is detailed in a variety of analyses: (i) speciation of Neisseria using nucleotide sequence from a single ribosomal protein locus (rplF); (ii) utilisation of variation at the 53 ribosomal protein gene loci to accurately and unambiguously identify and differentiate among bacterial species; (iii) identification of core genes and their comparison within a bacterial population; and (iv) the use of whole-genome population analysis for high-resolution studies, for example, the identification of potential disease outbreaks.

Forbes	Campylobacter Genotyping to Determine the Source of Human Infection	Clinical Infectious Diseases	Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom;National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, China	martin.maiden@zoo.ox.ac.uk	Campylobacter species cause a high proportion of bacterial gastroenteritis cases and are a significant burden on health care systems and economies worldwide; however, the relative contributions of the various possible sources of infection in humans are unclear. National-scale genotyping of Campylobacter species was used to quantify the relative importance of various possible sources of human infection. Multilocus sequence types were determined for 5674 isolates obtained from cases of human campylobacteriosis in Scotland from July 2005 through September 2006 and from 999 Campylobacter species isolates from 3417 contemporaneous samples from potential human infection sources. These data were supplemented with 2420 sequence types from other studies, representing isolates from a variety of sources. The clinical isolates were attributed to possible sources on the basis of their sequence types with use of 2 population genetic models, STRUCTURE and an asymmetric island model. The STRUCTURE and the asymmetric island models attributed most clinical isolates to chicken meat (58% and 78% of Campylobacter jejuni and 40% and 56% of Campylobacter coli isolates, respectively), identifying it as the principal source of Campylobacter infection in humans. Both models attributed the majority of the remaining isolates to ruminant sources, with relatively few isolates attributed to wild bird, environment, swine, and turkey sources. National-scale genotyping was a practical and efficient methodology for the quantification of the contributions of different sources to human Campylobacter infection. Combined with the knowledge that retail chicken is routinely contaminated with Campylobacter, these results are consistent with the view that the largest reductions in human campylobacteriosis in industrialized countries will come from interventions that focus on the poultry industry.	campylobacter infections,campylobacter jejuni,aves,campylobacter coli,chickens,developed countries,meat,models, genetic,ruminants,scotland,suidae,infections,economics,poultry meat,bacterial gastroenteritis,health care systems,genotype determination,campylobacter	2009-05-01 00:00:00

The impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred. Multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping. A reduction in serogroup C carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. Vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (ST)-11 complex serogroup C meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression. The impact of vaccination with MCC vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group C meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. The high impact on the carriage of ST-11 complex serogroup C could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. High vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups. 	disease transmission,neisseria meningitidis,vaccination,vaccines,vaccines, conjugate,herd immunity,serogroup	2008-04-01 00:00:00

Molecular approaches, specifically DNA amplification and sequencing, are the methods of choice for various reasons, including: their generic nature and portability, comprehensive coverage, and ready implementation to culture negative clinical specimens. The following target genes are recommended: (1) the variable regions of the antigen-encoding genes porA and fetA and, if additional resolution is required, the porB gene for rapid investigation of disease outbreaks and investigating the distribution of antigenic variants; (2) the seven multilocus sequence typing loci–these data are essential for the most effective national, and international management of meningococcal disease, as well as being invaluable in studies of meningococcal population biology and evolution. These targets have been employed extensively in reference laboratories throughout the world and validated protocols have been published. It is further recommended that a modified nomenclature be adopted of the form: serogroup: PorA type: FetA type: sequence type (clonal complex), thus: B: P1.19,15: F5-1: ST-33 (cc32).	diagnosis, serogroup, capsule, serotype, porin proteins, nucleotide sequence	2007-02-01 00:00:00

These genes were evolutionarily stable and exhibited a limited range of genetic variation, primarily generated by recombination. Translation of the gene sequences revealed a total of 19 distinct amino acid sequences in the variable regions of the protein, 6 of which were not recognized by currently available serosubtyping monoclonal antibodies. Knowledge of these aminoacid sequences permitted a rational re‐assignment of serosubtype names. Comparison of the complete genes with porA gene sequences from serogroup B and C meningococci showed that serogroup A possessed a limited number of the possible porA genes from a globally distributed gene pool. Each serogroup A subgroup was characterized by one of four porA gene types, probably acquired upon subgroup divergence, which was stable over periods of decades and during epidemiological spread. Comparison with other variable genes (pil and iga) indicated that the three alleles were independently assorted within the subgroup, suggesting that their gene types were older than the subgroups in which they occurred.

In addition to providing a standardized approach to data collection, by examining the nucleotide sequences of multiple loci encoding housekeeping genes, or fragments of them, MLST data are made freely available over the Internet to ensure that a uniform nomenclature is readily available to all those interested in categorizing bacteria. At the time of writing, over thirty MLST schemes have been published and made available on the Internet, mostly for pathogenic bacteria, although there are schemes for pathogenic fungi and some nonpathogenic bacteria. MLST data have been employed in epidemiological investigations of various scales and in studies of the population biology, pathogenicity, and evolution of bacteria. The increasing speed and reduced cost of nucleotide sequence determination, together with improved web-based databases and analysis tools, present the prospect of increasingly wide application of MLST.	molecular epidemiology, population structure, Neisseria meningitidis, strain characterization, Internet, high-throughput sequencing	2006-02-01 00:00:00

We identified 379 combinations of the MLST loci (sequence types) and 215 combinations of the cell-surface components among these isolates, which had been obtained from human disease, animals, food, and the environment. Despite this diversity, 748 (92%) of the isolates belonged to one of 17 clonal complexes, 6 of which contained many (318, 63%) of the human disease isolates. Several clonal complexes exhibited associations with isolation source or particular cell-surface components; however, the latter were poorly predictive of clonal complex. These data demonstrate that the clonal complex, as defined by MLST, is an epidemiologically relevant unit for both long and short-term investigations of C. jejuni epidemiology.

Population studies, which combine these data with epidemiological, phylogenetic, and evolutionary concepts, provide insights into the behaviour of pathogens that are unavailable from other approaches as they address questions of relevance to pathogenesis from the perspective of the infectious organism rather from that of the host. Hypothesis-driven analyses applied to these data permit the determination of microbial population diversity and structure, the identification of the mechanisms of genetic change in bacterial populations, and the generation of models of pathogen evolution. The nucleotide sequence-based population studies performed to date demonstrate a spectrum of nucleotide sequence diversity, population structure, and evolutionary mechanisms among pathogenic bacteria. The rapid development of nucleotide sequence determination and analysis techniques provides the tools necessary for the prosecution of population studies on an increasing number of bacterial pathogens.

Its presence in literature for 55 years is due to the ease in which it can distinguish between plastic and brittle materials. Achieving the correct balance of plastic and brittle materials in a formulation is critical to ensure adequate tablet strength is achieved therefore classifying materials using the Heckel equation is attractive. Despite the importance of this understanding, especially in the design and manufacture of direct compression formulations, there are no set analytical testing standards or materials classification guidelines. Instead many workers have attempted to develop techniques for the measurement and classification of a materials deformation but there is still confusion and contradiction present in this field. In this study we repot on report the effect of compaction pressure on the yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt. Ibuprofen and its sodium salt were selected as models for study due to the availability of comparative literature yield pressure values. The reported variation in yield pressure can be significant e.g, ibuprofen which has literature values of 21-1139 MPa. This study proposes an approach to determine yield pressure from the Heckel equation using a linear regression method. The full linear regression methodology utilised is described and is used to report the yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt dihydrate. This technique reveals the most representative compaction pressure in order to derive yield pressure to be 121 MPa. The yield pressure of ibuprofen and its sodium salt have been shown to increase with increasing compaction pressure. The reported values lie between 52-78 MPa for ibuprofen and 48-75 MPa for ibuprofen sodium dihydrate. The slightly lower reported yield pressure values for ibuprofen sodium suggest increased plasticity which could be attributed to the water contained within the structure acting as a plasticiser.

This was achieved using diffuse reflectance visible (DRV) spectroscopy and dye deposition, using the pH sensitive dye, thymol blue (TB). Two polymorphs, SFN-β and SFN-γ, of the drug substance sulfanilamide (SFN) were examined. The interaction of adsorbed dye with polymorphs showed different behavior, and thus reported different DRV spectra. Consideration of the acid/base properties of the morphological forms of the drug molecule provided a rationalization of the mechanism of differential coloration by indicator dyes. The kinetics of the polymorphic transformation of SFN polymorphs was monitored using treatment with TB dye and DRV spectroscopy. The thermally-induced transformation fitted a first-order solid-state kinetic model (R2=0.992), giving a rate constant of 2.43×10−2 s−1.

We describe a “cryptic” upwelling occurring in South Australian waters, in which cold upwelled waters do not reach surface waters and do not exhibit a sea surface temperature (SST) signature. Due to the wide continental shelf (ca. 100 km), upwelled waters form a sub-surface cold water pool and are forced north-west after a secondary event. Using flow cytometry we investigated the abundance and composition of viruses, heterotrophic bacteria and pico-phytoplankton within upwelling affected and unaffected waters. Our results identified the presence of upwelled waters at and below the Deep-Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM), where water temperature was at least 4 °C colder than surface waters. In contrast to previous studies, no significant differences were observed between upwelled and non-upwelled waters for most individual viral, bacterial and pico-phytoplankton sub-groups. However, one viral, one bacterial and two pico-phytoplankton sub-groups were significantly more abundant at the DCM. This indicates the presence of depth- and population-specific shifts in abundance and potential niche partitioning of these cytometrically-defined sub-groups that may be related to their host organisms and/or resource availability.

We investigated, within surface waters and the Deep Chlorophyll Max, the community composition and dynamics of flow cytometrically defined sub-populations of heterotrophic bacteria and virus-like particles in nearby water masses that were affected and unaffected by a localised wind-driven coastal upwelling. In contrast to previous studies we uniquely identified a 4-fold increase in total viral abundance and a decrease in bacterial abundance, from upwelled to offshore waters. Individual viral sub-populations were seen to correlate significantly to both bacterial populations and chlorophyll a, suggesting the possibility of individual viral populations infecting multiple host species rather than the often assumed single host species. The percentage of HDNA bacteria was high (84.3–93.4%) within upwelled waters, in accordance with the highest recorded values within an upwelling system, and decreased down to 35.5–42.6% away from the upwelling. Additionally, changes in the community composition of individual bacterial sub-populations suggest individual populations might be better adapted to distinct environments. We suggest that each flow cytometrically defined bacterial population may possess its own environmental niche where favourable conditions for that population result in an increase in abundance, cellular activity and productivity.	flow cytometry,coastal upwelling,viruses,bacteria,HDNA	2012-01-01 00:00:00

This paper uses Zipf analysis to evaluate serial data sets from the HOTS, BATS, EquaPac and high-resolution vertical profiles of FluoroMAP. Zipf analysis produced Zipf exponents from best-fit lines that permitted comparison among data sets. It allows comparison of one-dimensional series despite differences in scale and missing data. Zipf exponents ranged from 0.043 to 0.83. Serial data with sampling intervals of milliseconds and months showed exponents that ranged around 0.3. To the extent that Zipf exponents measure structure and variation, the indication is that structure of distributions is similar over millimeters and hundreds of kilometers. Zipf analysis provides a means to quantify similarities and differences, and suggests that variation is linked across many length scales for phytoplankton.

Spatial heterogeneity in bacterial abundance, or patchiness, was expressed as a coefficient of variation, and ranged from 5.5 to 75%. Discrete regions of enhanced bacterial abundance, as well as clear gradients in abundance across entire sample arrays were observed, with changes in bacterial abundance of up to 16-fold observed across a distance of 32 mm. The role of turbulence in influencing bacterial distribution patterns was examined in a series of laboratory experiments. Levels of heterogeneity were found to be up to 6.5 times higher in stirred than unstirred water samples under laboratory conditions. The gradients in bacterial abundance observed here suggest that small-scale processes operate within the marine microenvironment to create and maintain spatial structure in the bacterioplankton community. We suggest that previously hypothesised nanoscale Œhot spots¹ and microzones exist only as maxima within a continuously variable distribution of bacteria within the marine environment.

This required the development of a technique to view motile bacteria in situ. This was successfully achieved by replacing a 1-cm-diameter minicore from the mat sediment with 210- to 300-(mu)m-diameter glass beads or sieved agar. After allowing 3 days for regrowth of the mat into the transparent medium, a cross section showed that bacteria formed a layer as thin as 30 to 40 (mu)m at a depth of 500 (mu)m below the surface. Bacterial concentrations in this microlamination were 20 times above background. Mean speeds were 200 (mu)m s(sup-1) inside and 60 (mu)m s(sup-1) outside the microlamination. The percentages of bacteria turning per 30 s were 93% inside and 10% outside the microlamination. Artificial chemical gradients were unsuccessful in stimulating microlamination formation or in eliciting the same extent of speed and turning responses. The significance of the results is that it is now possible to microscopically examine sedimentary bacteria in situ. Our first examination indicates that some bacteria form chemotactic microlaminations by increasing their turning frequency. This behavior is opposite that described in the enteric-based model of chemotactic movement, in which positive chemotaxis is achieved by decreasing the turning frequency.

Extracted human third molars (n  =  10 per group) had orthodontic brackets bonded using one of four novel bioactive glass (BAG)-containing orthodontic bonding agents (BAG-Bonds) or commercially available Transbond-XT. The four new adhesives contained BAG in varying percentages incorporated into a traditional resin monomer mixture. Teeth were cycled through low-pH demineralizing and physiologic-pH remineralizing solutions once each day over 14 days. Microhardness was measured on longitudinal sections of the teeth 100, 200, and 300 µm from the bracket edge and beneath the brackets, at depths of 25 to 200 µm from the enamel surface. Normalized hardness values were compared using three-way analysis of variance. Significantly less reduction in enamel microhardness was found with the experimental adhesives at depths of 25 and 50 µm at all distances from the bracket edge. In all groups, there were no significant changes in enamel microhardness past 125-µm depth. Results varied with the different BAG-Bonds, with 81BAG-Bond showing the smallest decrease in enamel microhardness. The BAG-Bonds tested in this study showed a reduction in the amount of superficial enamel softening surrounding orthodontic brackets compared to a traditional bonding agent. The results indicate that clinically, BAG-Bonds may aid in maintaining enamel surface hardness, therefore helping prevent white spot lesions adjacent to orthodontic brackets.

An in vitro study	The Angle Orthodontist	Division of Biomaterials & Biomechanics, Department of Restorative Dentistry, Oregon Health & Science University	mitchelj@ohsu.edu	To measure ion release from four sol-gel bioactive glass–containing orthodontic resin bonding agents (BAG-Bonds) following immersion into simulated body fluid (SBF) at pH values of 4 and 7. Four BAG-Bonds, two containing fluoride, were developed. Prepared in our laboratory, the BAG-Bonds were composed of a mixture of resin monomers and bioactive glasses (BAGs). Workability of the final BAG-Bonds determined the amount of filler added to each, and this varied according to BAG composition. Commercially available Transbond-XT was used as the control. Three disks (10 mm × 2 mm) of each material were individually suspended in 3.5 mL of SBF at pH 4 and pH 7. SBF was analyzed to measure pH and ions released at 1 hour, 10 hours, and 100 hours. Calcium was measured by atomic absorption analysis, phosphate by ultraviolet visible spectrometry, and fluoride by an ion-specific electrode. The data were compared using a three-way analysis of variance, with P ≤ .05. Significant differences in calcium and phosphate ion release were found between the four BAG-Bonds and the control at multiple time points. Significant changes in pH were also found. There was no measureable release of fluoride from any of the materials. The BAG-Bonds showed the capacity for buffering acidic oral environments and significant release of calcium ions into their surrounding environment, and they hold the potential to be biomimetic bonding agents that may reduce white spot lesion formation.

Tubular occlusion produced by the bioactive glass was observed via SEM and a sustained reduction in hydrodynamic conductance was measured after exposure to various fluids and brushing. This new material may be used with the tested carriers to significantly and durably reduce tubule fluid flow, ultimately resulting in reduced dentinal hypersensitivity.

This essay argues that nationality is all too easily conflated with ‘race’ or ethnicity, such that a seeming essence or givenness is manifested amongst all those within a particular geographic boundary. It is suggested that on the contrary, there is nothing natural about nationality as commonly understood; this being so, it must be continually shored up and reconstituted through social, linguistic and material practices. For modern nations in the West, this has often entailed the marking or identification - racialisation - of non-nationals and non-white ‘Others’. A logic of inside/outside subtends the concept of nation wherein such Others are the ‘constitutive outside’ that invisibly clarifies and reinforces the status of those within. Nation, then, tacitly asserts and valorises its own putative qualities through the explicit identification and denigration of what it is not. It is argued that such a logic militates against the openness that might ground compassionate and empathetic relations between those ‘inside’ the nation and its new arrivals. This article first outlines its theoretical position: that nation is a ‘fictive ethnicity’ maintained through the continual (re)inscription of unequal power relations, and that nations and their ‘people’ are hybridities without originary ontological status. It summarises thereafter the historic constitution of national identities within both Northern Ireland and Ireland. Finally, it considers the experience of three groups of ‘Others’ on the island of Ireland, namely Jews, Travellers and asylum seekers, and how such Otherness has been represented in order to bolster the identity of the nation. This idea of nation and the exclusions it instates are interrogated throughout, with the conclusion that any policies aimed at eliminating institutional and individual racism, however well-meant, will ultimately fall short until nation itself - and the identities it is involved in constituting - are rethought.	‘Race’, nation, nationalism, belonging, recognition, ethnicity, culture, Jewishness, Traveller, asylum seeker 	2011-01-01 00:00:00

Participants were enrolled into the NIH-AARP Diet and Health study in 1995–1996 (median age 63) and BMI was reported at baseline and 9 years later (n=158,436). Sitting time (<3 [referent], 3–4, 5–6, 7–8 or ≥9 h/d), television viewing (None, <1, 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8, or ≥9 h/d) and the covariates (age, sex, race, education, smoking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, caloric intake, and sleep duration) were reported at baseline. We used longitudinal quantile regression to model changes at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th BMI percentiles. More sitting at baseline was associated with additional increases in BMI over time and the association was stronger at the upper BMI percentiles (e.g. <3h/d [referent] vs. 5–6 h/d sitting additional increases: 50th percentile = 0.41 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.48 & 90th percentile = 0.85 kg/m2, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.98). Similar associations were observed between more television viewing at baseline and additional increases in BMI over time (e.g., no television [referent] vs. 3–4 h/d of television: 50th percentile= 1.96 kg/m2, 95% CI: 1.77, 2.15 & 90th percentile = 2.11 kg/m2, 95% CI: 1.49, 2.73). Reducing sedentary behavior could help prevent an increase in BMI in adulthood, especially at the upper percentiles of the BMI distribution, and thereby reduce the prevalence of obesity.

Participants were children (n=2,097) enrolled in the control arm of the HEALTHY Study, who performed 20m shuttle run tests at ages 11 and 13. Self-reported screen time was used as a measure of sedentary behavior. Longitudinal quantile regression was used to model the influence of predictors on changes at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th shuttle run lap percentiles. Screen time (hrs/d) was the main predictor and adjustment was also made for VPA, body mass index and household education. In boys, more screen time was associated with fewer shuttle run laps completed from age 11 to 13 at the 25th, 50th and 75th shuttle run lap percentiles; the strongest association was at the 75th shuttle run percentile (-0.57, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.21). In girls, more screen time was associated with fewer shuttle run laps completed from age 11 to 13 at the 50th, 75th and 90th shuttle run lap percentiles; the strongest association was at the 90th shuttle run percentile (-0.65, -1.01 to -0.30). Borderline negative associations were found between screen time and shuttle run laps at the 10th shuttle run percentile in boys and girls (-0.28, -0.57 to 0.01 and -0.17, -0.41 to 0.06, respectively). More screen time was associated with lower CRF from age 11 to 13, independent of VPA.

The A/A homozygotes for rs8050136 had a higher BMI (kg/m2) compared to C/C homozygotes at baseline (32.8 (0.6) vs. 31.0 (0.4), respectively; P < 0.05) and at follow‐up (31.9 (0.6) vs. 30.4 (0.5), respectively; P < 0.05). Weight loss occurred after exercise, but there was no significant genotype by exercise interaction over time. Exploratory analyses among women exposed to moderate intensity exercise meeting, or exceeding, the physical activity recommendation found that those homozygous A/A lost significantly more weight than the C allele carriers (−3.3 (0.7) kg vs. −1.4 (0.4) kg and −1.5 (0.5) kg, respectively; P < 0.05). CRF, defined as VO2peak (oxygen consumption), increased after exercise and the magnitude of the increase was similar for each genotype. In conclusion, women genetically predisposed to being obese experienced weight loss and CRF benefits with moderate intensity exercise, with additional weight loss observed when the women met or exceeded the physical activity recommendations.

The recently developed S-transform (ST) combines features from both to reveal frequency variation over both space and time. The ST has been used successfully in the medical imaging field for noise removal and texture analysis of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. We have developed an ST-based texture analysis procedure capable of differentiating two genetically distinct forms of oligodendroglioma, a malignant brain tumor. As only one of these forms is sensitive to chemotherapy, correct classification is critical to proper treatment. While a brain biopsy is necessary to obtain tissue for genetic analysis, our method is non-invasive, utilizing only information from MR imaging. Oligodendroglioma is a malignant brain cancer. Unlike other brain tumors oligodendroglioma is sometimes sensitive to treatment with chemotherapy. It is known that a specific genetic abnormality, loss of the chromosomal arms 1p and 19q, is a strong predictor of this chemosensitivity. However, genetic analysis requires an invasive biopsy operation. Nevertheless, proper classification of tumor genotype is critical for disease management and patient prognosis. We present a noninvasive method for classifying oligodendroglioma tumors into 1p/19q deleted and intact groups using a new method we have developed for texture analysis of magnetic resonance images. Our results show a highly significant difference between the two tumor groups on each of three common MR contrasts.

Two critical components are required to generate smooth pursuit: first, because it is a voluntary eye movement, the subject must select a target to pursue to engage the tracking system; and second, generating smooth pursuit requires a moving stimulus. We examined whether this behavior also exists in the common marmoset, a New World primate that is increasingly attracting attention as a genetic model for mental disease and systems neuroscience. We measured smooth pursuit in two marmosets, previously trained to perform fixation tasks, using the standard Rashbass step-ramp pursuit paradigm. We first measured the aspects of visual motion that drive pursuit eye movements. Smooth eye movements were in the same direction as target motion, indicating that pursuit was driven by target movement rather than by displacement. Both the open-loop acceleration and closed-loop eye velocity exhibited a linear relationship with target velocity for slow-moving targets, but this relationship declined for higher speeds. We next examined whether marmoset pursuit eye movements depend on an active engagement of the pursuit system by measuring smooth eye movements evoked by small perturbations of motion from fixation or during pursuit. Pursuit eye movements were much larger during pursuit than from fixation, indicating that pursuit is actively gated. Several practical advantages of the marmoset brain, including the accessibility of the middle temporal (MT) area and frontal eye fields at the cortical surface, merit its utilization for studying pursuit movements.	eye movements; marmoset; primate; pursuit; vision	2015-04-01 00:00:00

Interest in this species has grown recently, in part due to the successful demonstration of transgenic marmosets. Here we examine the prospects of the marmoset model for visual neuroscience research, adopting a comparative framework to place the marmoset within a broader evolutionary context. The marmoset's small brain bears most of the organizational features of other primates, and its smooth surface offers practical advantages over the macaque for areal mapping, laminar electrode penetration, and two-photon and optical imaging. Behaviorally, marmosets are more limited at performing regimented psychophysical tasks, but do readily accept the head restraint that is necessary for accurate eye tracking and neurophysiology, and can perform simple discriminations. Their natural gaze behavior closely resembles that of other primates, with a tendency to focus on objects of social interest including faces. Their immaturity at birth and routine twinning also makes them ideal for the study of postnatal visual development. These experimental factors, together with the theoretical advantages inherent in comparing anatomy, physiology, and behavior across related species, make the marmoset an excellent model for visual neuroscience.

It consists of several retinotopic arrays of neuron-like units that are recurrently connected. The network is trained to make memory-guided saccades to sequentially flashed targets that appear at arbitrary locations. This task is interesting because the large number of possible sequences does not permit a pre-learned response. Instead locations and their priority must be maintained in active working memory. The network learns to perform the task. Surprisingly, after training it can also select targets in visual search tasks. When targets are shown in parallel it chooses them according to their salience. Its search behavior is comparable to that of humans. It exhibits saccadic averaging, increased reaction times with more distractors, latency vs accuracy trade-offs, and inhibition of return. Analysis of the network shows that it operates like a queue, storing the potential targets in sequence for later execution. A small number of unit types are sufficient to encode this information, but the manner of coding is non-obvious. Units respond to multiple targets similar to quasi-visual cells recently studied [Exp. Brain Res. 130 (2000) 433]. Predictions are made that can be experimentally tested.	Neural model,Frontal eye fields,Working memory,Visual search	2003-12-01 00:00:00

However, to realize graphene’s potential for a range of applications in materials science and nanotechnology there is a need to understand and control the interaction of graphene with tailored high-performance surfactants designed to facilitate the preparation, manipulation, and functionalization of new graphene systems. Here we report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the surface structure and dynamics on graphene of pyrene-oligoethylene glycol (OEG) -based surfactants, which have previously been shown to disperse carbon nanotubes in water. Molecular self-assembly of the surfactants on graphitic surfaces is experimentally monitored and optimized using a graphene coated quartz crystal microbalance in ambient and vacuum environments. Real-space nanoscale resolution nanomechanical and topographical mapping of submonolayer surfactant coverage, using ultrasonic and atomic force microscopies both in ambient and ultrahigh vacuum, reveals complex, multilength-scale self-assembled structures. Molecular dynamics simulations show that at the nanoscale these structures, on atomically flat graphitic surfaces, are dependent upon the surfactant OEG chain length and are predicted to display a previously unseen class of 2D self-arranged “starfish” micelles (2DSMs). While three-dimensional micelles are well-known for their widespread uses ranging from microreactors to drug-delivery vehicles, these 2DSMs possess the highly desirable and tunable characteristics of high surface affinity coupled with unimpeded mobility, opening up strategies for processing and functionalizing 2D materials.	2D micelles, surfactants, graphene, scanning probe microscopy, molecular dynamics	2017-03-01 00:00:00

In this report, we combine quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and ultrasonic force microscopy methods to investigate the changes in the film–substrate and film–environment interfaces of graphene and graphene oxide films, produced by diverse scalable routes, in both polar (deionised water) and non-polar (dodecane) liquid and vapour environments. In polar liquid environments, we observe nanobubble adsorption/desorption on the graphene film corresponding to a surface coverage of up to 20%. As no comparable behaviour is observed for non-polar environment, we conclude that nanobubble formation is directly due to the hydrophobic nature of graphene with direct consequences for electrode structures immersed in electrolyte solutions. The amount of water adsorbed by the graphene films was found to vary considerably from 0.012 monolayers of water per monolayer of reduced graphene oxide to 0.231 monolayers of water per monolayer of carbon diffusion growth graphene. This is supported by direct nanomechanical mapping of the films immersed in water where an increased variation of local stiffness suggests water propagation within the film and/or between the film and substrate. Transferred film thickness calculations performed for QCM, atomic force microscopy topography and optical transmission measurements, returns results an order of magnitude larger (46 ± 1 layers) than Raman spectroscopy (1 - 2 graphene layers) on pristine pre-transferred films due to contamination during transfer and possible turbostratic structures of large areas.

In this paper, we investigate the nanomechanics of normal (adhesive and elastic) and tangential (friction) forces between a stationary, moving, and ultrasonically excited nanoscale atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and exfoliated few layer graphene (FLG) on SiO2 substrate as a function of surrounding media—air, polar (water), and nonpolar (dodecane) liquids. We find that, while the friction coefficient is significantly reduced in liquids, and is always lower for FLG than SiO2, it is higher for graphene in nonpolar dodecane than highly polar water. We also confirm that in ambient environment the water meniscus dominates high adhesion for both hydrophobic FLG and the more hydrophilic SiO2 surface, with the lowest adhesion observed in liquids, in particular for FLG in dodecane, reflecting the low interface energy of this system. By using nanomechanical probing via ultrasonic force microscopy (UFM), we observed a profound reduction of graphene rippling and increase of graphene–substrate contact area in liquid environment. Friction force dependence on ultrasonic modulation amplitude suggests that dodecane at the graphene interface produces a solid-like “cushion” of approximately 2 nm thickness, whereas, in water immersion, the same dependence shows a remarkable similarity with the ambient environment, confirming the presence of a water meniscus in air, and suggesting negligible thickness of a similar water “cushion” on graphene. Dependence of friction on local environment opens new pathways for friction management in microfluidic and micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.

Baum	Fishing degrades size structure of coral reef fish communities	Global Change Biology	Department of Biology, University of Victoria, PO BOX 1700 Station CSC, Victoria, BC, V8W 2Y2 Canada	jpwrobinson@gmail.com	Fishing pressure on coral reef ecosystems has been frequently linked to reductions of large fishes and reef fish biomass. Associated impacts on overall community structure are, however, less clear. In size‐structured aquatic ecosystems, fishing impacts are commonly quantified using size spectra, which describe the distribution of individual body sizes within a community. We examined the size spectra and biomass of coral reef fish communities at 38 US‐affiliated Pacific islands that ranged in human presence from near pristine to human population centers. Size spectra ‘steepened’ steadily with increasing human population and proximity to market due to a reduction in the relative biomass of large fishes and an increase in the dominance of small fishes. Reef fish biomass was substantially lower on inhabited islands than uninhabited ones, even at inhabited islands with the lowest levels of human presence. We found that on populated islands size spectra exponents decreased (analogous to size spectra steepening) linearly with declining biomass, whereas on uninhabited islands there was no relationship. Size spectra were steeper in regions of low sea surface temperature but were insensitive to variation in other environmental and geomorphic covariates. In contrast, reef fish biomass was highly sensitive to oceanographic conditions, being influenced by both oceanic productivity and sea surface temperature. Our results suggest that community size structure may be a more robust indicator than fish biomass to increasing human presence and that size spectra are reliable indicators of exploitation impacts across regions of different fish community compositions, environmental drivers, and fisheries types. Size‐based approaches that link directly to functional properties of fish communities, and are relatively insensitive to abiotic variation across biogeographic regions, offer great potential for developing our understanding of fishing impacts in coral reef ecosystems.	body size; community structure; coral reef fish; exploitation; fisheries;25 macroecology;overfishing; size-based approaches; size spectra	2016-09-01 00:00:00

A recent Nature publication claims to have uncovered new latitudinal gradients in the evenness of reef communities and new reef hotspots based on functional diversity. Simulation models show that the purported evenness gradient is a mathematical inevitability of differences in species richness and detectability between vastly different marine ecosystems, namely ‘reefs’ in tropical, temperate, and polar regions. Constraints on evenness, along with disparity amongst communities in possible functional traits, cast doubt on the utility of global functional diversity comparisons for management of marine systems.

At one extreme are weak states with little capacity and ability to regulate economic or social relations. At the other are despotic states which dominate civil society. Yet there are others which are locked into an ongoing competition with civil society and it is these, not the despotic ones, that develop the greatest capacity. We develop a dynamic contest model of the potential competition between state (controlled by a ruler or a group of elites) and civil society (representing non-elite citizens), where both players can invest to increase their power. The model leads to different types of steady states depending on initial conditions. One type of steady state, corresponding to a weak state, emerges when civil society is strong relative to the state (e.g., having developed social norms limiting political hierarchy). Another type of steady state, corresponding to a despotic state, originates from initial conditions where the state is powerful and civil society is weak. A third type of steady state, which we refer to as an inclusive state, emerges when state and civil society are more evenly matched. In this case, each party has greater incentives to invest to keep up with the other, and this leads to the most powerful and capable type of state, while simultaneously incentivizing civil society to be equally powerful as well. Our framework highlights that comparative statics with respect to structural factors such as geography, economic conditions or external threats, are conditional — in the sense that depending on initial conditions they can shift a society into or out of the basin of attraction of the inclusive state.	civil society, contest, political divergence, state capacity, weak states	2017-01-01 00:00:00

We study the political consequences of such public income volatility. As is standard, in our model political incentives create inefficient policies to increase re-election probabilities, but we show that making public income uncertain creates specific new effects. Future volatility reduces the benefit of being in power, making policy more efficient. Yet at the same time it also reduces the re-election probability of an incumbent and since some of the policy inefficiencies are concentrated in the future, this makes inefficient policy, such as patronage public employment, less costly. Our model highlights a new political economy connection between the volatility of the public budget and economic growth. In the case where volatility comes from natural resource prices, a characteristic of many developing countries, we show that volatility in itself may be a source of inefficient resource extraction, jointly interacting with increased patronage employment.

State centralization induces citizens of different backgrounds, interests, regions or ethnicities to coordinate their demands in the direction of more general-interest public goods, and away from parochial transfers. This political agenda effect raises the effectiveness of citizen demands and induces them to increase their investments in conflict capacity. In the absence of state centralization, citizens do not necessarily band together because of another force, the escalation effect, which refers to the fact that elites from different regions will join forces in response to the citizens doing so. Such escalation might hurt the citizen groups that have already solved their collective action problem (though it will benefit others). Anticipating the interplay of the political agenda and escalation effects, under some parameter configurations, political elites strategically opt for a non-centralized state. We show how the model generates non-monotonic comparative statics in response to the increase in the value or effectiveness of public goods (so that centralized states and public good provision are absent precisely when they are more beneficial for society). We also suggest how the formation of a social democratic party may sometimes induce state centralization (by removing the commitment value of a non-centralized state), and how elites may sometimes prefer partial state centralization.	conáict, escalation e§ect, political agenda e§ect, public good provision, state capacity, state centralization	2016-01-01 00:00:00

I argue that the extent and persistence of poverty and violence in Colombia is a consequence of extractive facets of political institutions. These have two main dimensions; the very low quality of ëactually existing democracyí; and the ëJanus-facedí nature of the weak, ine§ective Colombian state. I provide an analysis of the political logic which maintains the extractive aspects of these institutions in place and how they interact with the inclusive aspects of Colombian institutions. I argue that Colombian institutions have become slowly less extractive over time because of elite attempts to counteract some of the internal contradictions of the coexistence of extractive and inclusive institutions. This has resulted in falls in poverty and violence and a gradual modernization of the country. Nevertheless, the powerful forces which have kept Colombia poor and violent remain in place and powerfully reproduce themselves. I outline what a solution to Colombiaís problems might look like.

We argue that general economic laws are unhelpful as a guide to understand the past or predict the future, because they ignore the central role of political and economic institutions, as well as the endogenous evolution of technology, in shaping the distribution of resources in society. We use regression evidence to show that the main economic force emphasized in Piketty's book, the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, does not appear to explain historical patterns of inequality (especially, the share of income accruing to the upper tail of the distribution). We then use the histories of inequality of South Africa and Sweden to illustrate that inequality dynamics cannot be understood without embedding economic factors in the context of economic and political institutions, and also that the focus on the share of top incomes can give a misleading characterization of the true nature of inequality.

We argue that empirical models that treat institutions and human capital as exogenous are misspecified, both because of the usual omitted variable bias problems and because of differential measurement error in these variables, and that this misspecification is at the root of the very large returns of human capital, about four to five times greater than that implied by micro (Mincerian) estimates, found in the previous literature. Using cross-country and cross-regional regressions, we show that when we focus on historically determined differences in human capital and control for the effect of institutions, the impact of institutions on long-run development is robust, whereas the estimates of the effect of human capital are much diminished and become consistent with micro estimates. Using historical and cross-country regression evidence, we also show that there is no support for the view that differences in the human capital endowments of early European colonists have been a major factor in the subsequent institutional development of former colonies.	economic development , fundamental and proximate causes	2014-08-01 00:00:00

We model the determination of local and national state capacity as a network game in which each municipality, anticipating the choices and spillovers created by other municipalities and the decisions of the national government, invests in local state capacity and the national government chooses the presence of the national state across municipalities to maximize its own payoff. We then estimate the parameters of this model using reduced-form instrumental variables techniques and structurally (with GMM or SMM). To do so we exploit both the structure of the network of municipalities over which spillovers take place and the historical roots of local state capacity as the source of exogenous variation. These historical instruments are related to the presence of colonial royal roads and local presence of the colonial state in the 18th century, factors which we argue are unrelated to current provision of public goods and prosperity except through their impact on their own and neighbors’ local state capacity. Our estimates of the effects of state presence on prosperity are large and also indicate that state capacity decisions are strategic complements across municipalities. Bringing all municipalities below median state capacity to the median, without taking into account equilibrium responses of other municipalities increases median fraction of the population above poverty from 57% to 60%. Approximately 57% of this is due to direct effects and 43% to spillovers. However, if we take the equilibrium response of other municipalities into account, the median would instead increase to 68%, a sizable change driven by equilibrium network effects.

We specifically investigate the explanatory power of the standard models of Eurasian state formation which emphasize the importance of high population density, inter-state warfare and trade as factors leading to political centralization. We find that while in the whole world sample these factors are indeed positively correlated with political centralization, this is not so in the African sub-sample. Indeed, none of the variables are statistically related to political centralization. We also provide evidence that political centralization, where it took place, was indeed associated with better public goods and development outcomes. We conclude that the evidence is quite consistent with the intellectual tradition initiated in social anthropology by Evans-Pritchard and Fortes in the 1940s which denied the utility of Eurasian models in explaining patterns of political centralization in Africa.

We first explain the theoretical reasons why democracy is expected to increase redistribution and reduce inequality, and why this expectation may fail to be realized when democracy is captured by the richer segments of the population; when it caters to the preferences of the middle class; or when it opens up disequalizing opportunities to segments of the population previously excluded from such activities, thus exacerbating inequality among a large part of the population. We then survey the existing empirical literature, which is both voluminous and full of contradictory results. We provide new and systematic reduced-form evidence on the dynamic impact of democracy on various outcomes. Our findings indicate that there is a significant and robust effect of democracy on tax revenues as a fraction of GDP, but no robust impact on inequality. We also find that democracy is associated with an increase in secondary schooling and a more rapid structural transformation. Finally, we provide some evidence suggesting that inequality tends to increase after democratization when the economy has already undergone significant structural transformation, when land inequality is high, and when the gap between the middle class and the poor is small. All of these are broadly consistent with a view that is different from the traditional median voter model of democratic redistribution: democracy does not lead to a uniform decline in post-tax inequality, but can result in changes in fiscal redistribution and economic structure that have ambiguous effects on inequality.

We investigate the impact of slavery on long-run development in Colombia. Our identification strategy compares municipalities that had gold mines during the 17th and 18th centuries to neighboring municipalities without gold mines. Gold mining was a major source of demand for slave labor during colonial times, and all colonial gold mines are now depleted. We find that the historical presence of slavery is associated with increased poverty and reduced school enrollment, vaccination coverage and public good provision. We also find that slavery is associated with higher contemporary land inequality.	Slavery,Public goods	2012-06-01 00:00:00

We show: (1) politicians tend to over-extract natural resources relative to the efficient extraction path because they discount the future too much, and (2) resource booms improve the efficiency of the extraction path. However, (3) resource booms, by raising the value of being in power and by providing politicians with more resources which they can use to influence the outcome of elections, increase resource misallocation in the rest of the economy. (4) The overall impact of resource booms on the economy depends critically on institutions since these determine the extent to which political incentives map into policy outcomes. Countries with institutions that promote accountability and state competence will tend to benefit from resource booms since these institutions ameliorate the perverse political incentives that such booms create. Countries without such institutions however may suffer from a resource curse.	Natural resources; Political economy; Clientelism	2006-04-01 00:00:00

What explains why involvement in Atlantic trade in the Early Modern period was positively correlated with economic growth in Britain but negatively correlated in Spain? Why did frontier expansion in the 19th Century Americas go along with economic growth in the United States and economic decline in Latin America? Why do natural resource booms seem to stimulate growth in some countries, but lead to a ëcurseíin others, and why does foreign aid sometimes seem to encourage, other times impede economic growth? In this paper we argue that the response of economies to shocks or innovations in economic opportunities depends on the nature of institutions. When institutions are strong, new opportunities or windfalls can have positive e§ects. But when institutions are weak they can have negative e§ects. We present a simple model to illustrate how comparative statics are conditional on the nature of institutions and show how this perspective helps to unify a large number of historical episodes and empirical studies.

The study is part of a series performed on 46 same sex twin animals. One of the pair received a subcutaneous implant of the GnRH agonist Goserelin acetate every four weeks while the other remained untreated. Implantation began immediately prior to puberty; at 8 weeks in the males and 28 weeks in the females (as timing of puberty is sex specific). To determine the effects of agonist treatment on the reproductive axis blood samples were collected for measurement of testosterone in the males and progesterone in the females. In addition the volume of the scrotum was determined. The present study aimed to determine whether there are sexually differentiated behavioural responses to a novel object at different stages of brain development (8, 28 and 48 weeks of age) and whether these responses are altered by GnRHa treatment. Approach behaviour towards and interactions with the novel object were monitored as was the number of vocalisations per unit time during the test period. GnRHa treatment suppressed testosterone concentrations and testicular growth in the males and progesterone release in the females. Sheep vocalised significantly more prior to weaning (8 weeks of age) than post weaning (28 and 48 weeks of age) suggesting stress on separation from their dams. Our current study shows that males are more likely to leave their conspecifics to approach a novel object than females. As this behaviour was not altered by suppression of the reproductive axis we suggest that, although sex differences are more obviously expressed in the phenotype after puberty, these may be developed during adolescence but not primarily altered during puberty by sex hormones.

Yet how a conservation project is designed and structured can negatively impact people’s access to resources, privilege one group of people over another, or protect some species at a cost to others. Ideological conflict among nature protectionists, advocates for indigenous people, those promoting a pro-poor agenda, and those seeking to move conservation into the economic mainstream has characterized the conservation debate. I argue that in practice, most conservation programs should adopt a pluralistic and pragmatic approach, adopting multiple goals and making decisions on the basis of what works. Choosing among approaches requires an appreciation of trade-offs, and consideration of biological, social, and cultural values. Ultimately conservation approaches must be sustainable – ecologically, culturally, socially, economically and politically – otherwise they will fail both practically and ethically.

Lefanowicz;John R Robinson	Regulation FD: A Review and Synthesis of the Academic Literature	Accounting Horizons	The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA	john.robinson@mccombs.utexas.edu	We summarize the empirical evidence regarding Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) to gauge whether the regulation achieves its stated objectives and to provide insights and direction for future research. Overall, we find that FD's prohibition against the selective disclosure of material information eliminates the information advantage enjoyed by certain investors and analysts and thereby provides a more level playing field for all investors. In addition, a number of firms respond to FD by expanding public disclosures, and the information environment of the average firm does not appear to be adversely affected. However, we find that an unintended consequence of FD is a reduction in the total amount of information available in the market (i.e., a “chilling effect”) for small or high-technology firms. Finally, ongoing research suggests that private access to management continues to provide select analysts or investors with non-material information used to complete the “mosaic” of information.

Regulators have expressed recurring concerns that quarterly guidance is associated with a misallocation of resources because it encourages management to focus on excessively short-term horizons. If so, firms providing quarterly guidance represent an acquisition opportunity for non-guiding firms because acquired resources can be redeployed towards more productive long-term uses. Based on prior research that finds value created by acquisitions accrues primarily to target shareholders, we predict that an expected increase in value from the termination of guidance will be observed in acquisition premiums. We find that, after controlling for the other determinants of acquisition gains, the premium paid for an acquired corporation is associated with the target's practice of issuing quarterly earnings guidance. Consistent with our prediction, we find that no incremental premium is paid to acquire guiding targets when the bidding firm also provides guidance.

We analyze the financial statement disclosures of 19 paper companies that received a total of $6.4 billion in refundable excise taxes during 2009. All of these companies included the refunds in financial income, but 14 excluded all or part of the refunds from taxable income. Despite the magnitude and unprecedented nature of the exclusion, we find that only five of the excluding firms accrued a full reserve for an uncertain tax position, three firms accrued a partial reserve, and six firms did not accrue any reserve. This variation suggests managers enjoy wide latitude in applying the more likely than not standard for determining additions to the reserve. Our findings suggest that financial statement users should exercise caution when comparing tax reserves across companies. In addition, we find some evidence that income-increasing tax accrual decisions are related to characteristics generally associated with weak corporate governance.

We find that the use and scope of GP contracts expanded dramatically for a large sample of firms acquired from 1980 through 1995. To investigate the effect of managerial incentives on target acquisition gains, we estimate a regression of abnormal stock returns for acquisitions on variables including managerial incentives, the value of GP payments, and the interaction between GPs and management incentives. The regression results indicate that management incentives are positively associated with target acquisition returns and that GP payments serve to mitigate this influence. We do not, however, detect any direct association between the level of GP payments and target gains.	Corporate acquisitions,Golden parachutes,Management incentives	2000-02-01 00:00:00

The likelihood of fracture is affected by menopausal status and a diagnosis of osteoporosis prior to breast cancer. Most women reported at least one assessment of bone mineral density. We have investigated the self-reported frequency and pattern of minimal-trauma fracture (MTF) in breast cancer (BC) survivors at least 5 years from diagnosis, along with the use of bone mineral density (BMD) assessment. This study was carried out within the Bupa Health Foundation Health and Wellbeing After Breast Cancer Study which is a questionnaire-based prospective cohort study of 1683 women diagnosed with their first invasive breast cancer between 2004 and 2006 and followed for at least 5 years. One thousand two hundred and five women, who remained free of recurrence or new breast cancer, completed the fifth annual follow-up. One hundred sixty-four (13.6 %) reported at least one MTF. Rib fracture was the most common (52 fractures in 46 women). Compared with women who remained pre-/peri-menopausal, either being postmenopausal at diagnosis (OR 3.53, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1.09–11.44, p = 0.036) or changing from pre- to postmenopausal during follow-up (OR 3.97, 95 % CI 1.21–13.10, p = 0.023) was associated with a higher likelihood of fracture, as was having a diagnosis of osteoporosis at the time of diagnosis (OR 1.74, 95 % CI 1.00–2.99, p = 0.047). Most women (64.9 %) reported at least one BMD assessment. Overall MTF is a problem for breast cancer survivors, with rib fracture a particular issue for women in our study. Both pre-existing osteoporosis and being postmenopausal are risk factors for subsequent MTF in women treated for breast cancer. Clinicians need to be mindful of fracture prevention medication in these groups.	Bone mineral density,Breast cancer,Minimal-trauma fracture	2014-10-01 00:00:00

The current study considers whether previously identified predictors of PTG may produce different outcomes dependent on the characteristics of the trauma experienced. Method: Active coping, avoidant coping, emotional coping, intrusive thoughts, social support, and spirituality were examined as potential mediators of relationships between trauma characteristics (interpersonal trauma, number of trauma types, and childhood trauma) and PTG. The responses of 268 adults exposed to multiple and wide-ranging stressors were used to generate three multiple mediation models. Results: Intrusive thoughts and social support exerted small but significant indirect effects in all three multiple mediation models. Avoidant coping mediated associations between the number of trauma types and PTG, and the relationship between childhood trauma to PTG. Conclusion: Relationships between trauma characteristics and PTG appear to be explained through the presence of avoidant coping strategies, intrusive thoughts, and the individual’s social environment, which could be the focus of intervention efforts to promote positive change.	coping, intrusive thoughts, posttraumatic growth, social support, trauma	2018-05-01 00:00:00

In recent years, researchers and practitioners have employed new (i.e. digital) technologies to test cognitive performance, with tablet computer based tasks often replacing traditional versions. However, the extent to which findings from traditional and touch screen tablet based tasks are equivalent remains unclear. In the present study, sixty participants (18 men and 42 women) completed both the Tower of Hanoi and Corsi Block tasks in their traditional (wooden) form and using a touch screen tablet. Performance outcome measures (span length, number of moves, and time taken) were recorded alongside subjective workload for each task. Findings revealed that number of moves and span length do not significantly differ between the traditional and tablet based versions of each task. However, the computerized Tower of Hanoi task was completed more quickly than the traditional version. Differences were noted for subjective workload with higher physical demand reported for the traditional versions of each task. Participants also reported the traditional Tower of Hanoi task to be more enjoyable but more mentally demanding. In conclusion, the touch screen versions of the Tower of Hanoi and Corsi Block tasks appear largely equivalent to the traditional versions.

This study compared the effects of a basic firefighter training course on 21 volunteers (with no firefighting experience) with age and gender-matched controls. Stress reactivity (salivary cortisol and anxiety) were monitored across the course: day 1 (classroom), day 2 (physical equipment training), and day 3 (simulated fire emergency). Cognitive performance (visual attention, declarative and working memory) considered important in surviving a fire emergency were measured immediately post-training or after a 20-min delay. Prior to threat subjects showed an anticipatory cortisol increase but no corresponding increase in self-reported anxiety. On day 3 cortisol was higher in firefighters tested immediately after (10.37 nmol · L−1) and 20 min after training (7.20 nmol · L−1) compared to controls (3.13 nmol · L−1). Differences in cognitive performance were observed post-threat, with impairments in visual declarative memory in the firefighting subjects tested immediately, and working memory impairments observed in those tested after a 20-min delay. Cognitive impairments were found following a simulated emergency and could explain maladaptive responses observed during real fires. Moreover, the results suggest the type of cognitive impairments observed may be time dependent, with different cognitive difficulties becoming evident at different times following an emergency.	anxiety; cortisol; fire emergency; memory	2013-06-01 00:00:00

KM received no rehabilitation post-stroke, as clinic assessments suggested that mental functioning had returned to an acceptable level. However, KM believed that his cognitive ability had not returned to pre-stroke levels. Comparisons with pre-stroke data from an unrelated study and additional testing using sensitive cognitive measures supported his observations. This research concludes that patient observations and more sensitive testing of post-stroke cognitive functioning may reveal additional high-level cognitive deficits.

The two studies reported here explored the impact of exposure to an acute naturalistic stressor on state anxiety, working memory and HPA axis activation (salivary cortisol). In both experiments, ten healthy male participants were exposed to an acute naturalistic stressor, helicopter underwater evacuation training (HUET), and their physiological and behavioural responses before (first study) and after (second study) the stressor were compared to ten non-stressed controls. The results of both experiments showed that working memory performance was preserved during anticipation of an acute stressor, but impairments were observed immediately after stress exposure. Participants reported significantly higher state anxiety levels during anticipation and following stress exposure, whereas significant elevations in cortisol levels were only observed 25 min post exposure to stress, but not before or immediately after stress exposure. The results of both experiments demonstrated a dissociation between behavioural and biochemical measures and provided evidence for a dissociation of the effects of stress on cognitive and physiological measures depending on the time of testing, with cognitive impairments most evident following stress exposure.

Since then, many additional ambrosia beetle symbionts have been added to the genus, including the important tree pathogens Raffaelea quercivora, Raffaelea quercus-mongolicae, and Raffaelea lauricola, causal agents of Japanese and Korean oak wilt and laurel wilt, respectively. The discovery of new and the dispersal of described species of Raffaelea to new areas, where they can become invasive, presents challenges for diagnosticians as well as plant protection and quarantine efforts. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive multigene phylogenetic analysis of Raffaelea. As it is currently defined, the genus was found to not be monophyletic. On the basis of this work, Raffaelea sensu stricto is defined and the affinities of undescribed isolates are considered.

Characteristics of M. epitea isolates from the Canadian arctic were compared to M. epitea isolates from temperate regions of North America. Sequences from internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA were obtained from urediniospores from rust-infected Salix leaves collected in the Canadian arctic and in Minnesota and compared. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal ITS regions indicated that arctic M. epitea samples were divergent from temperate M. epitea isolates, perhaps in part because all rusts examined diverged according to host species. Four urediniospore characteristics were examined: area, circularity (shape factor), major axis length and spine density. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed for spine density among all host species except S. nigra and S. bebbiana. However major axis length differed between these species. These results represent the first evidence that arctic and temperate Melampsora species on Salix hosts in North America have evolved distinct molecular and morphological characters.	arctic fungal diversity, fungal phylogenetics, fungal taxonomy, Melampsoraceae, Uredinales, willow diseases	2004-11-01 00:00:00

In addition, seselin, (+)‐epoxysuberosin, alosin, and (–)‐meranzin were found to inhibit NQO1 activity. Interestingly, (–)‐meranzin showed inhibitory activity comparable to the known potent NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol.	bioprospecting, coumarins, drug discovery, natural products, pressurized hot water extraction	2017-03-01 00:00:00

Optically active point defects in crystals have gained widespread attention as photonic systems that could be applied in quantum information technologies1,2. However, challenges remain in the placing of individual defects at desired locations, an essential element of device fabrication. Here we report the controlled generation of single negatively charged nitrogen–vacancy (NV−) centres in diamond using laser writing3. Aberration correction in the writing optics allows precise positioning of the vacancies within the diamond crystal, and subsequent annealing produces single NV− centres with a probability of success of up to 45 ± 15%, located within about 200 nm of the desired position in the transverse plane. Selected NV− centres display stable, coherent optical transitions at cryogenic temperatures, a prerequisite for the creation of distributed quantum networks of solid-state qubits. The results illustrate the potential of laser writing as a new tool for defect engineering in quantum technologies, and extend laser processing to the single-defect domain.	diamond, NV centres, laser processing, qubits, spin resonance	2016-06-01 00:00:00

Using binomial tests we show that several algal families contain more successful invaders than would be expected by chance, highlighting groups that should be targeted for management. Hull-fouling and aquaculture are the most significant sources of seaweed invaders and should be carefully regulated. The ecological effects of introduced seaweeds have been studied in only 6% of the species, but these studies show mostly negative effects or changes to the native biota. Herbivores generally prefer native to introduced seaweeds, and are unlikely to control spread, as they can do in other habitats. Undisturbed marine communities can be at least initially resistant to most introduced seaweeds aside from the siphonous green species; however, disturbances and eutrophication can facilitate invasion. Major research gaps include community-level ecological studies and economic assessments.	impact , invasive , macroalgae , native range , nonindigenous , vector	2007-12-01 00:00:00

Interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm will be affected by ambivalence toward alcohol, because ambivalent attitudes are worse predictors of behaviour than are homogeneous attitudes. It is therefore important to identify aspects of alcohol consumption about which young men are not ambivalent. In-depth interviews were conducted with a socioeconomically diverse sample of 31 men, aged 18–21 living in London, UK. Ambivalence toward alcohol was widespread. None of the drinkers who were interviewed had uncomplicated positive evaluations of drinking: all mentioned compelling reasons not to drink. Most motives for drinking were also identified as reasons for not drinking if consumption became excessive. However, three motives for not drinking were not also motives for drinking: violence, alcoholism, and cost. These findings should be considered during the design of interventions to reduce the health and social consequences of excessive alcohol consumption amongst young men.

Smith	Privacy-Aware Message Exchanges for HumaNets	Computer Communications	University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States	jms@cis.upenn.edu	This paper describes a novel privacy-aware geographic routing protocol for Human Movement Networks (HumaNets). HumaNets are fully decentralized opportunistic store-and-forward, delay-tolerant networks composed of smartphone devices. Such networks allow participants to exchange messages phone-to-phone and have applications where traditional infrastructure is unavailable (e.g., during a disaster) and in totalitarian states where cellular network monitoring and censorship are employed. Our protocol leverages self-determined location profiles of smartphone operators’ movements as a predictor of future locations, enabling efficient geographic routing over metropolitan-wide areas. Since these profiles contain sensitive information about participants’ prior movements, our routing protocol is designed to minimize the exposure of sensitive information during a message exchange. We demonstrate via simulation over both synthetic and real-world trace data that our protocol is highly scalable, leaks little information, and balances privacy and efficiency: messages are approximately 20% more likely to be delivered than similar random walk protocols, and the median latency is comparable to epidemic protocols while requiring an order of magnitude fewer messages.

We have employed technology derived from active networking research to develop a series of network monitoring systems, but unlike most previous work, made application needs the priority over infrastructure properties. This choice has produced the following results: (1) the techniques for general infrastructure are both applicable and portable to specific applications such as network monitoring; (2) tradeoffs can benefit our applications while preserving considerable flexibility; and (3) careful engineering allows applications with open architectures to perform competitively with custom-built static implementations. These results are demonstrated via measurements of the lightweight active measurement environment (LAME), its successor, flexible LAME (FLAME), and their application to monitoring for performance and security.

Smith	Creating Efficient Fail-Stop Cryptographic Protocols	echnical Reports (CIS)	Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States	jms@cis.upenn.edu	Fail-stop cryptographic protocols are characterized by the property that they terminate when an active attack is detected, rather than releasing information valuable to the attacker. Since such a construction forces attacks (other than denial-of-service) to be passive, the protocol designer's concerns can be restricted to passive attacks and malicious insiders. A significant advantage of such protocols is that by stopping and not attempting to recover, proofs about protocol behavior and security properties are greatly simplified. This paper presents a generic method of converting any existing (cryptographic) protocol into a fail-stop one, or designing new protocols to be fail-stop. Our technique uses cryptographic hashes to validate sequences of messages by reflecting message dependencies in the hash values. An informal proof of correctness is given. We apply it to an early version of Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) cryptographic protocol. We also suggest a possible application to TCP streams as a high-performance alternative to the per-packet authentication of IPSEC. The modified protocols require small increases in message size and the number of cryptographic operations relative to the initial non-fail-stop protocols.	network protocols , communication systems , computer communications , cryptography , computer network security , internet , eavesdropping , electronic mail	2002-07-01 00:00:00

Smith	Implementing a Distributed Firewall	ACM conference on Computer and communications security	Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States	jms@cis.upenn.edu	Conventional firewalls rely on topology restrictions and controlled netwrok entry points to enforce trafic filtering. Furthermore, a firewall cannot filter traffic it does not see, so, effectively, everyone on the protected side is trusted. While this model has worked well for small to medium size networks, networking trends such as increased connectivity, higher line speeds, extranets, and telecommuting threaten to make it obsolete. To address the shortcomings of traditional firewalls, the concept of a distributed firewall has been proposed. In this scheme security policy is still centrally defined, but enforcement is left up tp the individual endpoints. IPsec may be used to distribute credentials that express parts of the overall network policy. Alternatively, these credentials may be obtained through out-of-band means.

The programmable protocol processing pipeline (P4) exploits the dynamic reconfigurability of RAM based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to provide both hardware performance and dynamic functionality to network components. We use forward error correction (FEC) as an example of a protocol processing function which we insert and remove from the protocol stack on an as-needed basis. Our measurements show that the P4 is able to process the data stream at OC-3 (155 Mbps) link rate, and consequently improve the TCP performance in noisy environments.

Scott Alexander;William Arbaugh;Angelos D. Keromytis;Jonathan M. Smith	A Secure Active Network Environment Architecture	IEEE network	Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States	jms@cis.upenn.edu	An active network is a network infrastructure which is programmable on a per-user or even per-packet basis. Increasing the flexibility of such network infrastructures invites new security risks. Coping with these security risks represents the most fundamental contribution of active network research. The security concerns can be divided into those which affect the network as a whole and those which affect individual elements. It is clear that the element problems must be solved first, since the integrity of network-level solutions will be based on trust in the network elements. In this article we describe the architecture and implementation of a secure active network environment (SANE), which we believe provides a basis for implementing secure network-level solutions. We guarantee that a node begins operation in a trusted state with the AEGIS secure bootstrap architecture. We guarantee that the system remains in a trusted state by applying dynamic integrity checks in the network element's runtime system, using a novel naming system, and applying node-to-node authentication when needed. The construction of an extended LAN is discussed.

Their present taxonomy is not concordant with what we know of their phylogeny. Further progress in this area is hindered by a lack of information concerning their morphology. As recent studies have shown, a historical reliance on live observations for species descriptions has resulted in a number of errors and omissions. Here, we redescribe the anatomy of the male copulatory organ of Prognathorhynchus busheki using transmission electron and confocal microscopy, correcting several errors in the original description. Furthermore, we use these results to update our understanding of the anatomy and evolution of male copulatory organs in Gnathorhynchidae and in Platyhelminthes more generally.	stylet, flatworms, reproduction, meiofauna, prostatic vesicle	2016-05-01 00:00:00

In many cases, the proboscis is armed with hooks, derived either from the extracellular matrix that surrounds the muscles or from intracellular deposits in the epithelium covering the proboscis. Glands associated with the proboscis reportedly are venomous; however, there are few direct tests of this hypothesis. This article reviews the structure and current knowledge of the function of the proboscis in the Kalyptorhynchia, points to areas in which the current understanding of phylogenetic relationships within this taxon is incongruent with our hypothesis of how the proboscis evolved, and addresses areas in need of further research, especially as regards functional morphology and biomechanics.

Fegley	Diagnostic PCR can be used to illuminate meiofaunal diets and trophic relationships	Invertebrate Biology	Department of Biology, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina	smithj@winthrop.edu	Analysis of the meiofaunal food web is hampered because few prey have features that persist long enough in a predator's digestive tract to allow identification to species. Hence, at least for platyhelminth predators, direct observations of prey preference are almost nonexistent, and where they occur, prey identification is often limited to the phylum level. Studies using an in vitro approach are rare because they are extremely time‐consuming and are subject to the criticism that predators removed from their natural environment may exhibit altered behaviors. Although PCR‐based approaches have achieved wide application in food‐web analysis, their application to meiofaunal flatworms suffers from a number of limitations. Most importantly, the microscopic size of both the predator and prey does not allow for removal of prey material from the digestive tract of the predator, and thus the challenge is to amplify prey sequences in the presence of large quantities of predator sequence. Here, we report on the successful use of prey‐taxon‐specific primers in diagnostic PCR to identify, to species level, specific prey items of 13 species of meiofaunal flatworms. Extension of this method will allow, for the first time, the development of a species‐level understanding of trophic interactions among the meiofauna.	diet analysis, flatworms, food webs, nematodes, predation	2014-06-01 00:00:00

One reason teachers find it challenging to introduce microscopy at the elementary level is because children can have a hard time connecting the image of an object seen through a microscope with what they see with their unaided eyes. This is especially true if students are viewing a greatly magnified object, such as what would be seen through a compound microscope. This kind of microscope, most often used at the high school or university level, can magnify objects from 100 up to 1,000 times their actual size. However, by using low-powered microscopes--microscopes that magnify objects between 10 and 30 times their actual size, microscopy can be successfully introduced at the elementary level, providing a solid foundation for later learning with compound microscopes. Through a partnership between a university biology department and college of education and a local elementary school, microscopy was introduced to third grade classes. As a result, students have shown more interest in science and their science grades have improved. The authors would like to share this project to inspire other educators to seek out opportunities for collaboration between elementary schools and nearby universities or high schools.

Smith;Mark Ellwood	Feeding Patterns and Emotional Care in Breastfed Infants	Social Indicators Research	Australian Centre for Economic Research on Health, Australian National University	julie.smith@anu.edu.au	A number of studies have suggested breastfed infants have improved bonding and attachment or cognitive development outcomes. However, mechanisms by which these differences might develop are poorly understood. We used maternal time use data to examine whether exclusively breastfeeding mothers spend more time in close interactive behaviors with their infants than mothers who have commenced or completed weaning. Mothers (188) participating in a time use survey recorded infant feeding activities for 24 h over a 7 day period using an electronic device. Tracking was conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months postpartum. Data was collected for maternal activities including infant feeding and time spent in emotional care. The mothers of exclusively breastfed infants aged 3–6 months fed them frequently and total time spent in breastfeeding averaged around 17 h a week. Maternal time spent in emotional care was also substantial, and found to correlate positively with time spent breastfeeding. Exclusively breastfed infants received greatest amounts of emotional care from their mother, and exclusively formula fed infants the least. Mixed fed infants received more emotional care time than formula fed infants, but less than fully breastfed infants. These findings may help explain the differential cognitive developmental outcomes reported in the medical literature for breastfed and non breastfed infants.

Public Health Nutrition	Australian Centre for Economic Research on Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia	julie.smith@anu.edu.au	To assess the public health significance of premature weaning of infants from breast milk on later-life risk of chronic illness. A review and summary of recent meta-analyses of studies linking premature weaning from breast milk with later-life chronic disease risk is presented followed by an estimation of the approximate exposure in a developed Western country, based on historical breast-feeding prevalence data for Australia since 1927. The population-attributable proportion of chronic disease associated with current patterns of artificial feeding in infancy is estimated. After adjustment for major confounding variables, current research suggests that the risks of chronic disease are 30–200 % higher in those who were not breast-fed compared to those who were breast-fed in infancy. Exposure to premature weaning ranges from 20 % to 90 % in post-World War II age cohorts. Overall, the attributable proportion of chronic disease in the population is estimated at 6–24 % for a 30 % exposure to premature weaning. Breast-feeding is of public health significance in preventing chronic disease. There is a small but consistent effect of premature weaning from breast milk in increasing later-life chronic disease risk. Risk exposure in the Australian population is substantial. Approximately 90 % of current 35–45-year-olds were weaned from breast-feeding by 6 months of age. Encouraging greater duration and exclusivity of breast-feeding is a potential avenue for reducing future chronic disease burden and health system costs.

This paper briefly reviews recent scientific evidence on links between poor early life nutrition and obesity in later life, which suggests that artificial baby milk rather than breastfeeding in infancy is associated with a 30-50% higher likelihood of later life obesity. It then presents data on long-term trends in breastfeeding in Australia and on consumption of infant milk products since 1939. Evidence is also presented of increased marketing and promotion of breastmilk substitutes from the mid 1950s, including through the healthcare system, associated with the emergence of increased competition in the Australian infant food industry. This collaborative marketing effort by industry and health professionals in turn contributed importantly to the sharp decline in breastfeeding from the mid 1950s. As a consequence, most Australians born since 1955 were exposed to artificial baby milk in early infancy. A substantial proportion of Australian infants are still partially fed with artificial baby milk in the first 12 months of life. The example of infant food highlights that the healthcare system and the food industry, and not just individual mothers' choices, have contributed to poor infant nutrition and obesity trends in Australia. Redressing healthcare system and industry practices to restore a supportive environment for breastfeeding is thus argued to be a necessary element of the public health response to the current obesity problem.

The 18O/16O ratio of 100% of the oxygen in calcite and aragonite was determined directly by combining data from a two-step procedure involving thermal decomposition of the carbonate, followed by fluorination of the residual CaO using BrF5. The oxygen isotope composition of the CO2 released upon the thermal decarbonation of calcite and aragonite is enriched in 18O relative to that of the remaining CaO. Reproducibility of the oxygen isotope composition of the CO2 derived from each of the decarbonation and fluorination steps was 0.55‰ (1σ). Nevertheless, statistically reliable acid fractionation factors for calcite (se = 0.07) and aragonite (se = 0.10) were determined on the basis of a large set of combined data from conventional phosphoric acid reactions at three different temperatures, plus the decarbonation/fluorination procedure. The acid fractionation factors (αCO2(ACID)-carbonate) determined in this study for calcite (αCO2(ACID)–Calcite = 1.01030) and aragonite (αCO2(ACID)–Aragonite = 1.01063) at 25 °C, differ slightly from previously published values. On the basis of our new determinations at 25, 50, and 75 °C, revised expressions for the temperature dependence of the acid fractionation factors for calcite and aragonite are proposed for the temperature range of 25–75 °C	Oxygen isotope,Acid fractionation factor,Phosphoric acid,Carbonate,Calcite,Aragonite	2007-12-01 00:00:00

We conclude that Eupersicaria is monophyletic and most closely related to Tovara and Echinocaulon. In turn, this clade is most closely related to Cephalophilon. The sister group of this entire Persicaria clade contains Bistorta and a clade including Aconogonon and Koenigia, which supports the monophyly of the Persicarieae. Within Eupersicaria there appears to be a deep split between P. amphibia and the remaining species, and there is strong conflict regarding the placement of P. punctata.

However, few clinical trials have investigated the effects of the biocompatible solution on residual renal function (RRF). We performed a prospective, randomized trial with patients starting continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Ninety-one incident patients started CAPD for 12-month treatment with either LF (Balance®, Fresenius, n = 48) or CF (CAPD/DPCA®, Fresenius, n = 43). RRF, peritoneal solute transport rate and solute clearance were measured every 6 months. LF had a significant effect on the change of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ( P = 0.048 by the mixed model). In per-protocol analysis, GFR in the LF group did not decrease over a 12-month period, while GFR in the control group significantly decreased (0.13 ± 33.4 L/ week/1.73 m 2 for LF versus −13.6 ± 19.4 L/week/1.73 m 2 for CF, P = 0.049). Subgroup analysis for patients with initial GFR of 2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or above showed a significantly higher GFR for the LF group over the 12-month period. At Month 13, serum total CO 2 levels were higher and serum albumin levels were lower in the LF group. No differences between the two groups were observed for the C-reactive protein. Over the 12-month period, effluent cancer antigen-125 levels significantly increased in the LF group, compared with those of the CF group, while effluent interleukin-6 levels were not different between the two groups.	end-stage renal disease, glucose degradation products, peritoneal dialysis, randomized controlled trials, residual renal function	2009-04-01 00:00:00

We analyzed the available data from 862 elderly people in the Korean Longitudinal Study on Health and Aging. Over a 5-year observational period, 151/862 (17.5%) participants died, and a high albumin-adjusted anion gap (SAAG) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in unadjusted analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41–2.71) and fully adjusted analyses (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.24–2.52), compared with a low SAAG group. The population attributable fraction of death due to high SAAG was 38.2% (95% CI 20.7–58.2%). In particular, the participants with high SAAG had higher cardiovascular and infection-related mortality rates than those with low SAAG (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.06–4.19, and HR, 9.69; 95% CI, 1.12–83.4, respectively).

However, the therapeutic strategy may differ from that of non-PD-related hypokalemia. We investigated clinical features and related factors of de novo hypokalemia in incident PD patients. We retrospectively enrolled 82 normokalemic patients starting PD at Gachon University Gil Hospital, Korea. The patients were divided into hypokalemia (K+<3.5 mEq/L) and normokalemia (3.5 mEq/L≤K+<5.5 mEq/L) groups based on the plasma potassium levels at month 13, and then clinical parameters including peritoneal function and adequacy tests and biochemical parameters were compared. Eight patients who showed hyperkalemia (K+≥5.5 mEq/L) at month 13 were excluded from our analyses. The incidence of hypokalemia in PD patients was 7.3% in a year. The de novo hypokalemia (n=6) and normokalemia (n=68) groups had no significant differences in baseline characteristics. The serum albumin levels and normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA) at month 1 were not significantly different between the two groups. At month 13, on the other hand, serum albumin levels and nPNA were significantly lower in the hypokalemia group (P=0.014; P=0.006, respectively).

However, it is unclear whether there is an independent relationship between renal function and CAC. Therefore, we evaluated the association between renal function and CAC. We retrospectively reviewed 870 Korean patients who had undergone computed tomographic coronary angiography. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study formula with an ethnic factor for the Korean population. The CKD stages were classified using estimated GFR (eGFR) and proteinuria. CAC is related to late stage CKD in nondialyzed patients. These findings emphasize that individuals with CAC should be considered a high-risk population for decreased renal function.

In those segments it mediates HCO3- secretion and chloride (Cl-) absorption. In mice, no renal abnormalities are observed under basal conditions, and individuals with genetic disruption of the pendrin (SLC26A4) gene (Pendred syndrome) have normal acid-base balance. In contrast, there are definite differences under conditions wherein the transporter is stimulated. In animal studies, pendrin (SLC26A4) is upregulated with aldosterone analogues, Cl- restriction, and metabolic alkalosis, and is down-regulated with Cl loading and metabolic acidosis, independently. However, the exact role of pendrin in humans has not been established to date, and further examinations are necessary.	pendrin; SLC26A4; acidosis, renal tubular; metabolic alkalosis	2009-06-01 00:00:00

After the introduction of medical therapy such as with statins and angiotensin blocking agents, it has been considered a very slowly progressive disease. In the 1990s, surgical methods were compared to radiological intervention and showed no additional benefits. Recent clinical data also demonstrate that in cases of relatively stable atherosclerotic renovascular disease, medical therapy is as effective as other interventions with regard to patient outcomes. In this paper the recent clinical outcomes are reviewed.	atherosclerosis; renal artery obstruction; hypertension	2010-12-01 00:00:00

However, no studies have been conducted regarding volume management in cases where a sudden change of body fluid occurs, such as during puerperium in hemodialysis patients. This report presents a case in which the patient was monitored for her body composition and her volume status was controlled using a body composition monitor (BCM) during the puerperal period. This case suggests that using a BCM for volume management may help maintain hemodynamic stability in patients with a rapidly changing volume status for a short term period, such as during puerperium.	body composition; hemodialysis; postpartum period; volume control	2011-12-01 00:00:00

These NSP are not degraded by endogenous digestive enzymes of pigs. The purpose of this study was to determine if supplemental enzymes could increase the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients in nursery pigs fed corn DDGS, alter short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and affect gut health. Two independent studies were carried out using an in vitro porcine model and in vivo model. For the in vitro study, enzymatically digested residue of DDGS was used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments: supplemental xylanase (0 or 1500 endo-pentosanase unit of xylanase/kg of the diet) and supplemental mannanase (0 or 400 unit of mannanase/kg of diet). For the in vivo study, corn-soybean meal based diets with 15% corn DDGS were formulated using thirty-two newly weaned pigs in a randomized complete block design for 4 treatments in the similar fashion as in vitro study. Plasma and mucosa were collected for tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements. Digesta samples from jejunum and ileum were collected to measure viscosity, pH, and AID of nutrients including NSP components. Supplemental xylanase increased (P < 0.05) concentration of SCFA, acetate, and propionate, and AID of total NSP, arabinoxylan, and GE. Supplemental xylanase also increased (P < 0.05) villus height in the duodenum, proliferation rate in the crypt of jejunum, and the concentrations of claudin, occludin, and ZO-1 in jejunum, whereas reduced (P < 0.05) the viscosity of jejunal digesta. Supplemental Mannanase increased (P < 0.05) production of butyrate and AID of mannan and occludin concentration, whereas tended to decrease (P = 0.057) MDA level in the jejunum. An interaction effect (P < 0.05) was found between xylanase and mannanase for digestibility coefficient of arabinoxylan and ZO-1 concentration. In conclusion, the use of supplemental xylanse and mannanase were able to improve digestibility of targeted NSP and improve gut health. Hence, these enzymes can be used separately or together depending upon the type of ingredients used in the feed and amount of substrate (xylan or mannan) available for enzymes to degrade in diets for nursery pigs to enhance utilization of different fibrous coproducts and improve gut health.

Crossbred pigs (n = 1,408; 21 d of age and 7.1 ± 0.3 kg BW; Smithfield Premium Genetics, Rose Hill, NC) were randomly assigned to 4 treatments (16 pens/treatment and 22 pigs/pen) in a randomized complete block design: 0, 15, 30, and 45% of lactose replaced by CCF based on equal amounts of total sugars. The experimental period was divided into 3 phases: phase I (1.8 kg diet/pig for 11 ± 1 d), phase II (6.8 kg diet/pig for 17 ± 2 d), and phase III (until 49 d after weaning). Pigs received a common phase III diet. The levels of lactose, supplied by whey permeate (79.3 ± 0.8% lactose), were 20, 8, and 0% in phase I, II, and III, respectively. All experimental diets contained the same levels of essential AA and energy (ME) for each phase. Fecal scores were observed on d 5, 7, and 9 after weaning. Blood samples were taken at the end of phase I and II to measure blood urea N. The duration of phase I tended to linearly decrease (P = 0.063) with increasing CCF. In phase I, the ADFI increased (P < 0.05) with increasing CCF whereas ADG and G:F did not change. In phase II, the duration and ADFI did not change whereas ADG linearly decreased (P < 0.05) with increasing CCF. However, the G:F was not changed as CCF increased. During phase I and II together, the duration was linearly decreased (P < 0.05) as CCF increased, whereas no difference in growth performance was observed. Overall, ADFI, ADG, and G:F were not affected by replacing whey permeate with CCF in diets, indicating no adverse effects of a candy coproduct as a carbohydrate substitute to lactose on growth performance of nursery pigs. Blood urea N did not change in phase I but tended to linearly increase (P = 0.088) in phase II as CCF increased. There were no differences in fecal scores and mortality as CCF increased. However, increasing CCF tended to linearly decrease (P = 0.083) morbidity, which implies no adverse effects of a candy coproduct replacement on health status of nursery pigs. In conclusion, a candy coproduct can be used to replace up to 45% of dietary lactose for nursery pigs without negative effects on growth performance or health status. A candy coproduct could be an economical alternative to partly replace the use of lactose in swine production.	candy coproduct, growth performance, lactose, nursery pigs	2015-12-01 00:00:00

A total of 888 (half male and half female) 1-d-old Ross 308 chickens were weighed and randomly allotted to 7 treatments in a randomized complete block design for 21 d, including a basal diet (BD), the BD + 0.095% L-Met or DL-Met, the BD + 0.190% L-Met or DL-Met, and the BD + 0.285% L-Met or DL-Met (representing 60, 70, 80, and 90% of the Met + Cys requirement). Feed disappearance and BW were recorded every 7 d. Liver and duodenum samples were collected on d 0, 7, and 21 to measure redox status and intestine morphology. On d 7, chicks fed a diet supplemented with either 0.285% l-Met or 0.285% DL-Met had increased (P < 0.05) concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and reduced (P < 0.05) protein carbonyl (PC) and malonedialdehyde contents in duodenum mucosa compared with chicks fed the BD. Chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% L-Met had greater (P < 0.05) villus width compared with chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% DL-Met. Chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% L-Met had lower (P < 0.05) crypt depth and greater (P < 0.05) villus height:crypt depth ratio compared with chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% DL-Met or the BD. On d 21, chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% L-Met had increased (P < 0.01) concentrations of GSH and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) but reduced (P < 0.05) PC content in duodenum mucosa compared with chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% DL-Met and the BD. Chicks fed a diet supplemented with 0.285% L-Met had greater (P < 0.05) villus height compared with chicks fed the BD. During the entire 21-d supplementation of either L-Met or DL-Met, ADG and G:F were enhanced (P < 0.01) compared with chicks fed the BD. Chicks fed diets supplemented with L-Met had greater (P < 0.05) ADG and G:F than chicks fed diets supplemented with DL-Met. The relative bioavailability of L-Met to DL-Met for ADG and G:F was 138.2 and 140.7%, respectively. Overall, supplementation of either L-Met or DL-Met has beneficial effects on villus development in association with increased GSH production and levels of TAC and reduced protein oxidation in duodenum. Supplementation of L-Met served a better function on redox status and development of the gut of chicks compared with DL-Met. Chicks fed diets with L-Met had better growth response than chicks fed diets with DL-Met.	broiler chicken, dl-methionine, growth, l-methionine	2015-06-01 00:00:00

For 12 d after weaning, pigs were fed phase 1 nursery diets with either 0% SDPP (PP0) or 6% SDPP (PP6). After 12 d, pigs were fed phase 2 diets for 3 wk. Pigs fed PP0 in phase 1 continued to be fed a phase 2 diet with no SDPP (PP0/PP0) or were fed a diet including corn naturally contaminated with multiple mycotoxins (M), labeled PP0/PP0M. Pigs fed SDPP in phase 1 were fed either a diet with no SDPP (PP6/PP0), a diet with M and no SDPP (PP6/PP0M), a diet with M and 3% SDPP (PP6/PP3M), or a diet with M and 6% SDPP (PP6/PP6M). During phase 1, pigs fed PP6 had increased (P < 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and G:F, whereas immunological parameters were not altered. During phase 2, pigs consuming PP0/PP0M had reduced ADG (P < 0.01) and ADFI (P < 0.05) in contrast to pigs fed PP0/PP0, whereas the performance of pigs fed PP6/PP0M was intermediate to pigs fed PP0/PP0M and PP6/PP0. The ADG and ADFI did not differ for pigs fed PP0/PP0M and PP6/PP0M during phase 2. Performance of pigs fed PP6/PP3M in contrast to pigs fed PP6/PP0M during phase 2 did not differ; however, these pigs had lower (P < 0.05) tumor necrosis factor α and tended (P = 0.094) to have lower DNA damage. During phase 2, ADG and ADFI of pigs fed PP6/PP6M did not differ from pigs fed PP6/PP0M, but G:F tended (P = 0.067) to be increased in pigs fed PP6/PP6M. Over the entire study period, pigs fed PP0/PP0M had reduced (P < 0.05) ADG and tended (P = 0.067) to have reduced ADFI. During this time, pigs fed PP6/PP0M tended to have greater ADG and ADFI (P = 0.093 and P = 0.067, respectively) compared with pigs fed PP0/PP0M. Overall, feeding a diet with SDPP improved growth performance and feed intake of young pigs directly after weaning. Feeding multiple M had a negative impact on growth performance of pigs during this trial. This response was more significant when pigs were not fed SDPP in phase 1. Overall, when combining phase 1 and 2 performance data, daily gain and feed intake tended to be reduced when pigs were not fed 6% SDPP in phase 1. This study indicates that the composition of diets fed immediately after weaning may be important for pigs that subsequently are under a M challenge.	aflatoxin, fumonisin, mycotoxins, pigs, spray dried plasma protein	2014-07-01 00:00:00

Potential applications may dually benefit both agricultural and medical sciences (e.g., “agrimedical research”). The broad scope of this review is to outline the fundamental elements of the piglet model and to highlight key aspects of relevance to various macronutrients, including lipids, carbohydrates, proteins/amino acids, and calcium/phosphorus. The review examines similarities between piglets and infants and also piglet idiosyncrasies, concluding that, overall, the piglet represents an adaptable and robust model for pediatric nutrition and metabolism research.	agrimedical , milk , infant , fatty acid , oligosaccharide , amino acid , calcium , phosphorous	2014-02-01 00:00:00

Sows were classified into 4 treatments based on gestation housing systems and social ranks within each gestational pen: sows housed in individual gestational crates were in control treatment (CON), and sows destined to high, middle, or low social ranks within each pen were classified into high social rank treatment (HR), middle social rank treatment (MR), and low social rank treatment (LR). The social rank of sows within a pen was determined by their winning percentage during aggressive interactions observed for a 4-d period after mixing on d 35 of gestation. Plasma samples collected from each sow on d 35, 60, 90, and 109 of gestation and d 1 and 18 of lactation were used to determine concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), IgG, and IgM. Sows in HR had higher (P < 0.05) body weight during gestation and lactation, smallest (P < 0.05) litter weight at birth, increased (P < 0.05) number of stillborn than sows in MR and LR, and tended to have decreased (P = 0.073, P = 0.064) number of born alive compared with sows in CON and LR. Sows in LR had lower farrowing rate compared with sows in MR. Plasma concentration of protein carbonyl in HR was higher (P < 0.05) than that in MR on d 3 of lactation. Plasma concentrations of 8-OHdG in LR was greater (P < 0.05) than that in HR on d 90 of gestation, d 3 and 18 of lactation, and greater (P < 0.05) than CON on d 18 of lactation. The reproductive performance of sows from all of the social ranks was related to their oxidative stress status during gestation and lactation. Collectively, the reproductive performance, oxidative stress status, and immune status did not differ between sows housed in gestational crates (CON) and pens (HR + MR + LR). Sows in CON and MR did not show inferior reproductive performance during gestation and lactation. Sows in HR and LR had increased oxidative damage during late gestation and lactation which could contribute to the reduced litter size and litter weight in HR and lower farrowing rate in LR.	oxidative stress, reproductive performance, social rank, sow	2013-10-01 00:00:00

This summary will handle how feeding strategies can be adjusted according to the nutrient needs for a sow to enhance productivity and health. Most research data used in this summary are based on the studies conducted by the authors between 1996 and 2013. Nutrient requirements of sows are affected by stage of gestation and parity of sows. Dietary antioxidant concentrations need to be re-evaluated for its sufficiency in sow diets especially to prevent excessive oxidative stress during late gestation and lactation. When feeding sows, consideration of phase feeding of gestating sows and parity feeding of lactating sows could enhances production longevity and health of sows.

Kim;Sung Woo Kim	Effects of increasing tryptophan intake on growth and physiological changes in nursery pigs	Journal of Animal Science	Department of Animal Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA	sungwoo_kim@ncsu.edu	Tryptophan (Trp) as a precursor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has long been used to extenuate aggressive behavior and control stress of humans as well as several farm animals. This study was conducted to determine the effect of supplemental L-Tryptophan (L-Trp) on growth, cerebral 5-HT concentration, stress hormone concentration, oxidative stress status, and behavior response of pigs under social stress, and also to determine an optimal daily total Trp intake that would benefit nursery pigs under social stress. Seventy two individually housed barrows at 6 wk of age were randomly allotted to 6 treatments with supplementation of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 g L-Trp/kg to corn and soybean meal-based feedstuffs. Pigs were fed assigned feedstuffs for 15 d. Body weight was measured on d 0, 5, 10, and 15. Saliva and blood were collected on d 5, 10, and 15. On d 5 and 10, all 12 pigs in each treatment were paired in 6 new pens to record behavior for a 2-d period and returned to original individual pens. On d 15, pigs were euthanized to obtain hypothalamus. During the first 5 d, ADG and G:F increased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing supplemental L-Trp. During the entire 15 d, ADG and G:F increased (linear, P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) with increasing supplemental L-Trp. Estimates of the daily total Trp intake based on ADG on d 15 were 10.8 g/d (P < 0.01; R2 = 0.16) using a 1-slope broken-line analysis. Hypothalamic 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid increased (linear, P < 0.01 and P = 0.03, respectively) with increasing supplemental L-Trp. Malonedialdehyde in plasma and hypothalamus, as well as salivary cortisol, on d 15 decreased (linear, P = 0.01, P < 0.01, and P < 0.01, respectively) with increasing supplemental L-Trp. Plasma urea nitrogen decreased (linear, P < 0.01) with increasing supplemental L-Trp. Increasing supplemental L-Trp affected pig behaviors during the first 2-d observation period by decreasing (quadratic, P = 0.04) lying, decreasing (linear, P = 0.04) sitting, and increasing (linear, P = 0.02) drinking. Overall, supplementation of L-Trp improved growth performance of 6 wk-old nursery pigs under social stress in association with increasing hypothalamic 5-HT production, reducing stress hormone concentrations, decreasing lipid peroxidation, increasing drinking, and reducing sitting and lying. Increase in BW gain of nursery pigs under social stress was maximal when daily total Trp intake was 10.8 g.	growth, nursery pigs, serotonin, stress, tryptophan	2012-01-01 00:00:00

At 5 d before breeding, sows were allotted to 2 dietary treatments representing 1) sows fed a diet with 12.0 g of fermentation product/d through gestation and 15.0 g of fermentation product/d through lactation (SCFP treatment, n = 22), and 2) sows fed a diet with equal amounts of a mixture of corn and soybean meal instead of the SCFP (CON treatment, n = 20). Sow BW and backfat thickness were recorded. Blood was collected from sows, as well as piglets, for the measurement of cell numbers, plasma urea nitrogen (PUN), and IgG. Fecal samples from d 7 to 9 of lactation were collected to determine apparent total tract nutrient digestibility. The composition of colostrum and milk was also measured. No difference (P > 0.10) in reproductive performance was observed between treatments. However, sows in the SCFP treatment tended to have increased total litter weaning weight (P = 0.068) and litter BW gain (P = 0.084) compared with sows in the CON treatment. Neutrophil count was decreased (P < 0.05) by adding the fermentation product on d 110 of gestation and d 17 of lactation, whereas a decreased (P < 0.05) white blood cell count was observed only on d 110 of gestation. Concentration of PUN tended to be greater (P = 0.069) for sows in the CON treatment compared with sows in the SCFP treatment on d 110 of gestation. Apparent total tract nutrient digestibility values of ash, CP, DM, and ether extract were not affected (P > 0.10) by adding the fermentation product. Protein and fat contents in colostrum and milk did not differ (P > 0.10) between treatments. Colostrum from sows in the SCFP treatment contained a greater (P < 0.05) amount of ash than colostrum from sows in the CON treatment. Immunoglobulin G measured in the colostrum, milk, and plasma of piglets did not differ (P > 0.10) between sows in the CON and SCFP treatments. This study indicates that adding the SCFP in the gestation and lactation diets has the potential to 1) improve litter BW gain during lactation, possibly by improving maternal protein utilization, as shown in a tendency to reduce PUN; 2) improve the maternal health status, as shown by the reduced neutrophil cell count; and 3) increase milk production, as shown in a tendency to improve litter BW gain without affecting nutrient composition of the colostrum and milk.	litter weight gain;milk;nursing pig;Saccharomyces cerevisiae fermentation product;sow	2011-03-01 00:00:00

Sows have limited ability to support the growth of fetuses and mammary glands during late gestation and to support mammary growth and milk production, especially during first lactation period. A series of studies was conducted to characterize requirements and ideal ratios of AA for 1) fetal growth, 2) mammary gland growth of gestating sows, 3) maternal tissue gain of gestating sows, 4) mammary gland growth of lactating sows, and 5) maternal tissue gain of lactating sows. A total of 97 pregnant sows and their fetuses and a total of 174 lactating sows and their nursing piglets were used for these studies to collect fetal tissues, mammary tissues, and maternal tissues for AA analysis. Requirements and ideal ratios of AA for sows changed dynamically depending on stages of pregnancy. Suggested daily requirements for true ileal digestible Lys were 5.57 and 8.78 g, and relative ideal ratios for Lys:Thr:Val:Leu (on basis of AA weight) were 100:79:65:88 and 100:71:66:95 for d 0 to 60 and d 60 to 114 of gestation, respectively. Requirements and ideal ratios of AA for lactating sows changed dynamically depending on potential amounts of protein mobilization from maternal tissues, which are related to voluntary feed intake and milk production. Suggested ideal ratios for Lys:Thr:Val:Leu were 100:59:77:115 and 100:69:78:123 if BW losses of sows during 21 d of lactation are 0 and 33 to 45 kg, respectively. To optimize efficiency of dietary protein utilization by sows, the dietary AA content and ratios can be adjusted by stages of pregnancy (i.e., phase feeding) and by expected feed intakes or parities of sows during lactation (i.e., parity-split feeding) considering the dynamic changes in the requirements and ideal ratios of AA.

Sixty-four pregnant gilts with BW of 195.0 ± 2.1 kg and backfat (BF) thickness of 12.9 ± 0.2 mm were assigned to 4 dietary treatments from d 60 of gestation (late gestation) to d 21 of lactation. Dietary treatments were 1) a control diet; 2) a high-protein diet (HP); 3) the control diet + 0.2% O3FA (O3); and 4) the HP diet + 0.2% O3FA (HPO3). For the control and O3 treatments, CP contents were 12.3% for late gestation and 17.9% for lactation, and for the HP and HPO3 treatments, CP contents were 18.4% for late gestation and 19.5% for lactation. On d 60 and 110 of gestation and after farrowing (within 12 h postfarrowing), on d 10 and 21 of lactation, BW, BF thickness, and blood samples were obtained. The total number of piglets and the number of piglets born alive and their birth weights were measured within 12 h postfarrowing. Colostrum and milk samples were obtained on d 2 and 21 of lactation, respectively. All piglets were weaned at 21 d. The wean-to-estrus interval and ADFI were recorded. The same measurements were obtained from the control and O3 groups during the subsequent parity. Dietary treatment did not affect BW, BF thickness, ADFI, and the wean-to-estrus interval of sows during their first reproductive cycle. Supplementation of O3FA increased both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid contents (P < 0.05) in colostrum and mature milk. First-parity litter size and piglet birth weight did not differ among treatment groups. Piglet BW was greater (P < 0.05) for the O3 group compared with both the control and HPO3 groups at d 10 and 21 of lactation. The same pattern was also noted for overall piglet BW gain. Both piglet and litter characteristics of the HP group did not differ from those of other groups throughout lactation. During the subsequent parity, both total and live piglet birth weights tended (P < 0.07) to be greater for the O3 group than for the control group. Compared with the control group, piglet BW and BW gain in the O3 group showed a pattern similar to the previous parity. Results indicated that O3FA alone during lactation improved the growth of nursing piglets, regardless of parity. However, the O3FA diet, with or without elevated protein, did not affect first-parity gestation performance, although O3FA alone may have improved piglet birth weight in the subsequent litter.	gestation,lactation,n-3 fatty acid,protein,sow	2008-12-01 00:00:00

Sows were grouped by parity (parity 1 to 12). Pigs within a group were then allotted to treatments. Treatments consisted of: CON (no added yeast culture) and YC (12 and 15 g/d XPC during gestation and lactation, respectively). Sows were housed individually and fed their assigned gestation and lactation diets from d 35 of gestation to d 21 of lactation. Sows were fed 2.0 kg/d during gestation and ad libitum during lactation. Voluntary feed intake was measured daily during lactation. At farrowing, numbers of pigs born total and alive were measured. Weights of litters were measured at birth and weaning on d 21 of lactation. Litter weight gain of the YC treatment was 6.9% greater (p<0.01) than that of the CON. However, voluntary feed intake of sows and litter size did not differ between treatments. This study indicates that dietary yeast culture supplementation benefits sow productivity by improving litter weight gain. At present, it is not confirmed if improved litter weight gain was due to milk production, which remains to be investigated.	Yeast Culture; Sow; Litter Weight Gain	2008-07-01 00:00:00

At 30 d of gestation, pregnant gilts were allotted based on BW to 1 of 2 diets supplemented with 1% L-Arg·HCl or 1.7% L -Ala (isonitrogenous control). After farrowing, sows were further allotted based on BW within previous gestation treatment groups to 1 of 2 lactation diets supplemented with 1% L-Arg·HCl or 1.7% L-Ala (isonitrogenous control). All gestation diets contained 3.1 Mcal/kg and 12.2% CP (as is) and were fed 2 kg/d in 2 equally sized meals, whereas all lactation diets contained 3.2 Mcal/kg and 18.6% CP (as is) and were fed ad libitum. Litter size was standardized to 10 piglets by cross-fostering within 24 h postfarrowing. On a weekly basis, BW and backfat (BF) thickness of sows, as well as piglet BW were measured, and blood and milk samples were obtained from the sows. Number of days from weaning to estrus and ADFI were also recorded. There were no differences in BW, BF thickness, ADFI, or days until return to estrus among treatment groups. There was no effect of the gestation diet or a gestation × lactation diet interaction on any parameter measured. On d 7 of lactation, plasma concentrations of Arg and insulin in sows, as well as concentrations of most AA in milk, were greater (P < 0.05) in response to Arg supplementation during lactation compared with the control. Weight gain of piglets from sows fed the Arg-supplemented diet during lactation was greater between d 0 and 7 (P < 0.01) and between d 0 and 21 (P < 0.05) of lactation compared with piglets from sows fed the control diet. Collectively, results from this study indicate the potential beneficial effects of dietary Arg supplementation in improving the lactation performance of first-parity sows.

Mateo;Yulong Yin;Guoyao Wu	Functional Amino Acids and Fatty Acids for Enhancing Production Performance of Sows and Piglets	Asian Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences	Texas Tech University;Texas A&M University	sungwoo.kim@ttu.edu	The growth and health of the fetus and neonate are directly influenced by the nutritional and physiological status of sows. Sows are often under catabolic conditions due to restrict feeding program during pregnancy and low voluntary feed intake during lactation. The current restrict feeding program, which aims at controlling energy intake during gestation, results in an inadequate supply of dietary protein for fetal and mammary gland growth. Low voluntary feed intake during lactation also causes massive maternal tissue mobilization. Provision of amino acids and fatty acids with specific functions may enhance the performance of pregnant and lactating sows by modulating key metabolic pathways. These nutrients include arginine, branched-chain amino acids, glutamine, tryptophan, proline, conjugated linoleic acids, docosahexaenoic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid, which can enhance conception rates, embryogenesis, blood flow, antioxidant activity, appetite, translation initiation for protein synthesis, immune cell proliferation, and intestinal development. The outcome is to improve sow reproductive performance as well as fetal and neonatal growth and health. Dietary supplementation with functional amino acids and fatty acids holds great promise in optimizing nutrition, health, and production performance of sows and piglets.

Phytobiotics refer bioactive compounds from plant materials including essential oils and herbal extracts. In Exp. 1, 144 pigs, weaned at 23.4??.3 d age, were allotted to three dietary treatments. Treatment diets were: 1) NC (no antibiotics and no phytobiotics); 2) PC (NC+carbadox, 50 mg/kg); and 3) PB (NC+phytobiotics; 0.1% PEP1000-1??. Each treatment had six replicates with eight pigs per pen. Pigs were fed the experimental diets for 5 wks in 3 phases (phase 1 for 2 wk; phase 2 for 2 wk; phase 3 for 1 wk). In Exp. 2, 192 pigs, weaned at 19.2??.3 d age, were allotted to three dietary treatments: 1) NC; 2) PC; and 3) PBO (NC+phytobiotics; 0.2% or 0.1% PEP1000-1??and organic acids; 0.4% or 0.2% Biotronic??for the phase 1 and 2, respectively) with eight replicates per treatment and eight pigs per pen. Pigs were fed the assigned diets for 5 wks in 2 phases (phase 1 for 2 wk; phase 2 for 3 wk). Body weights were measured at the beginning of the experiment and at the end of each week in both Exp. 1 and 2. Feed intake was measured at the end of each week in both Exp. 1 and 2. Diarrhea score was measured daily during the entire period for Exp. 1 and during the phase 1 for Exp. 2. In Exp. 1, the PC had a higher (p<0.05) overall ADG than the NC, but the overall ADG of the PB did not differ (p>0.05) from the NC or the PC. In Exp. 2, the overall ADG did not differ (p>0.05) among all the treatments during the entire experimental period. The overall ADFI and the overall gain:feed ratio did not differ (p>0.05) among all the treatments during the entire experimental period in both Exp. 1 and 2. The PC had a higher (p<0.05) overall diarrhea score (harder stools) than the NC and the PB in Exp. 1, and a higher (p<0.05) overall diarrhea score than the NC in Exp. 2. The overall diarrhea score of the PB and the PBO did not differ (p>0.05) from the NC or the PC in Exp. 1 and 2. Results from this study show that the growth of pigs fed the diets with phytobiotics or the combination of phytobiotics and organic acids did not differ from those both with antibiotics and without antibiotics when tested in an environmentally controlled research facility. Further experiments are required to study the growth performance in disease challenged conditions.	Diarrhea Score; Growth Performance; Organic Acids; Phytobiotics; Nursery Pigs	2006-12-01 00:00:00

In Exp. 1, 120 pigs were allotted to 3 dietary treatments without HS (control) or with HS1 at 0.5 and 1.0% (8 pens/treatment and 5 pigs/pen) and fed diets, based on a 5-phase feeding program, from weaning (d 21.3 ± 0.3 of age) to 60 kg of BW. In Exp. 2 and 3, 384 pigs (192 for each experiment) were allotted to 3 dietary treatments without HS, with HS1, or with HS2 (0.5%) for Exp. 2 and without HS, or with HS3 or HS4 (0.5%) for Exp. 3 (8 pens/treatment and 8 pigs/pen in each experiment). Pigs were fed diets, based on a 6-phase feeding program, from weaning (25.4 ±0.2 and 23.6 ±0.3 d of age for Exp. 2 and 3, respectively) to 110 kg of BW. In Exp. 4, 96 pigs were weaned at 22.1 ±0.2 d of age and allotted to 2 treatments without or with HS1 at 0.5% (6 pens/treatment and 8 pigs/pen), and in Exp. 5 96 pigs were weaned at 20.9 ±0.3 d of age and allotted to 3 treatments without HS, or with HS3 or HS4 (0.5%; 4 pens/treatment and 8 pigs/pen). Pigs were fed the diets for at least 2 wk before they were moved to an environmental chamber to measure aerial ammonia and hydrogen sulfide for 48 h at 5-min intervals. In Exp. 1, pigs fed diets with HS1 at 0.5% had greater (P <0.05) ADG during phase 3 and greater (P <0.05) G:F during phases 3 and 5 than control pigs. In Exp. 2, pigs fed diets with HS1 or HS2 at 0.5% had greater (P <0.05) ADG and G:F than control pigs during the entire feeding period, whereas in Exp. 3 HS3 or HS4 did not improve pig growth performance. Ammonia emission from manure was reduced by 18 or 16% when pigs were fed diets with HS1 (P = 0.067) or HS4 (P = 0.054), respectively. The results of this study indicate that the effects of dietary HS are variable but may improve growth performance of pigs and reduce ammonia emission from manure. Further research is needed to clarify these effects and the mechanisms by which HS may cause them.	: ammonia, carcass characteristic, growth performance, humic substance, pig	2006-09-01 00:00:00

Size, composition, and histomorphology of MG were determined during gestation in 29 primigravid gilts. Gilts were allotted randomly to 6 slaughter groups: d 45 (n = 6), 60 (n = 4), 75 (n = 5), 90 (n = 4), 102 (n = 5), and 112 (n = 5) of gestation. Mammary glands were obtained at slaughter, and skin and extraneous fat pad were removed to obtain parenchymal MG tissue. Mammary glands were further separated into individual MG, and their locations were recorded. Individual MG were weighed and bisected in an approximate midsagittal section to measure cross-sectional area. Mammary glands were ground individually and pooled according to anatomical region: the first and second pairs of MG = anterior MG; the third, fourth, and fifth pairs of MG = middle MG; the sixth, seventh, and eighth pairs of MG = posterior MG. Contents of DM, CP, ether extract, and crude ash were measured. Wet weight, DM, CP, and ash content of total and individual MG increased (P < 0.01) between d 45 and 112 of gestation. Cross-sectional area of individual MG increased (P < 0.01) as gestation progressed. Percentage of CP and ash increased (P < 0.01), whereas percentage of ether extract decreased (P < 0.01) as gestation progressed. This inverse relationship between percentages of CP and ether extract (r = −0.999; P < 0.0001) was consistent with the histological shift from primarily an adipose tissue in early gestation to one containing extensive lobuloalveolar tissue in late gestation. Wet weight of middle MG was greater (P < 0.05) than that of posterior MG at d 102 and 112 of gestation, and amount of CP in middle MG was greater (P < 0.05) than that in anterior and posterior MG at d 102 and 112 of gestation, indicating that middle MG grow faster than other MG during late gestation. Rates of wet weight gain and protein accretion were accelerated (P < 0.01) after d 74 and 75 of gestation, respectively, indicating the importance of MG growth during the last trimester of gestation. The increase in rate of protein accretion after d 75 indicates a greater protein requirement for MG growth during later gestation.	anatomical location, gilt, mammary gland, pregnancy, swine	2006-04-01 00:00:00

Blanton;Sung Woo Kim	Growth and compositional changes of fetal tissues in pigs	Journal of Animal Science	Texas Tech University, Department of Animal and Food Sciences, Lubbock	sungwoo.kim@ttu.edu	Three hundred twenty fetuses were obtained from 33 pregnant gilts (Camborough-22, Pig Improvement Co.) to determine rates of nutrient deposition in fetal tissues and to estimate nutrient requirements for fetal growth. Pregnant gilts were fed an equal amount of a gestation diet (2.0 kg/d; as-fed basis), and were slaughtered at d 0, 45, 60, 75, 90, 102, or 110 of gestation (n = 3 to 6 per day). Fetuses were dissected into carcass and individual tissues (including gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, heart, kidney, spleen [≥d 75]), and partial placental collection was made for chemical analysis. Fetal tissues were weighed and analyzed for DM, ash, CP, and crude fat. Regression equations were obtained to explain the weight and compositional changes of individual tissues during gestation. Weights of the fetus, carcass, gastrointestinal tract, liver, heart, lung, and kidney increased cubically (P < 0.001), whereas brain weight increased linearly (P < 0.001) as gestation progressed. Fetal protein and fat contents increased quadratically (P < 0.001) as gestation progressed (R2 = 0.906 and 0.904, respectively). Changes in fetal protein and fat contents fit a multiphasic regression that consisted of two linear equations (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.988 and P < 0.001, R2 = 0.983, respectively), indicating that protein and fat growth accelerated after d 69 of gestation. Fetal protein and fat accretions were 0.25 and 0.06 g/d (P < 0.001) before d 69 of gestation, and increased to 4.63 and 1.09 g/d (P < 0.001) after d 69 of gestation. Protein needs for tissue protein gains increased 19-fold after d 69 of gestation. Results of this study indicate that the growth of the fetus and fetal tissues occurs at different rates during gestation and support the practice of a two-phase feeding strategy (before and after approximately d 70 of gestation) for pregnant gilts.

The pigs (n = 24; 7 d old) were removed from sows to a nursery facility and assigned randomly to 1 of the 3 treatments representing diets supplemented with 0, 0.2, or 0.4% L-arginine (on the basis of milk replacer powder). Each milk feeder was assigned to 1 dietary treatment. Fresh liquid milk replacer (18.6% dry matter) was provided daily (∼0800 h) to piglets. Body weights of piglets were measured and jugular venous blood samples were obtained for metabolite analysis at d 7, 14, and 21 of age. Food intake did not differ between control and arginine-supplemented piglets [66.7 vs. 69.5 g dry matter/(kg body wt · d)]. Compared with control piglets, dietary supplementation with 0.2 and 0.4% L-arginine dose dependently increased (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of arginine by 30 and 61%, and decreased (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of ammonia by 20 and 35%, and those of urea by 19 and 33%, respectively. Dietary supplementation with 0.4% L-arginine also increased (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of insulin and growth hormone by 24–27% in piglets, compared with controls. Between 7 and 21 d of age, the supplementation of 0.2 and 0.4% L-arginine to piglets enhanced (P < 0.05) average daily weight gain by 28 and 66%, and body weight by 15 and 32%, respectively, compared with control piglets. Collectively, both the metabolic and growth data demonstrate unequivocally that arginine is deficient in milk-fed young pigs and that this arginine deficiency represents a major obstacle to maximal growth in piglets.	pigs, milk replacer, arginine, growth, nutrition	2004-03-01 00:00:00

Use of humic substances in swine diets is a novel concept. Humic substances contain 8,700 mg/kg of iron but its bioavailability is unknown. This study was conducted to test the bioavailability of iron in humic substances for nursery pigs. One hundred twenty five pigs (Newsham, Colorado Springs, CO) were not given supplemental iron while nursing for 21 d. Pigs were weaned on d 21 and allotted to one of five treatments (four control treatments with different levels of supplemented iron; 0, 30, 70 and 88 mg/kg from FeSO4 and one treatment with 70 mg/kg iron from humic substances). Pigs were fed diets for 5 wk ad libitum and water was accessible freely. Body weight and feed intake were measured weekly. Blood samples were taken from pigs on d 28 to measure the number of red blood cells and hemoglobin concentration. Pigs fed a diet with the humic substances grew faster (p0.05).

The simple cross-bar structure of the RRAM and good ductility of aluminum electrode results in excellent flexibility and mechanical endurance. Particularly, bipolar and unipolar resistive switching (BRS, URS) behavior appeared simultaneously were investigated. Depending on the current compliance, BRS or URS could be selectively observed. Furthermore, the permanent transition from BRS to URS was observed with a specific current compliance.

In addition, in a RS test, the device has a large current ratio of 5 × 103 in positive bias region and 5 × 105 in negative bias region. Then, to evaluate an ability of data storage for the proposed memory devices, we measured a retention time for 104 s at room temperature (RT) and 85 °C as well. As a result, the set and reset states were stably maintained with a current ratio of ∼102 at 85 °C to ∼103 at RT.

Electronics that degrade after stable operation for a desired operating time, called transient electronics, are of great interest in many fields, including biomedical implants, secure memory devices, and environmental sensors. Thus, the development of transient materials is critical for the advancement of transient electronics and their applications. However, previous reports have mostly relied on achieving transience in aqueous solutions, where the transience time is largely predetermined based on the materials initially selected at the beginning of the fabrication. Therefore, accurate control of the transience time is difficult, thereby limiting their application. In this work, we demonstrate transient electronics based on a water-soluble poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) substrate on which carbon nanotube (CNT)-based field-effect transistors were fabricated. We regulated the structural parameters of the PVA substrate using a three-dimensional (3D) printer to accurately control and program the transience time of the PVA substrate in water. The 3D printing technology can produce complex objects directly, thus enabling the efficient fabrication of a transient substrate with a prescribed and controlled transience time. In addition, the 3D printer was used to develop a facile method for the selective and partial destruction of electronics.	three-dimensional printer, transient electronics, poly(vinyl alcohol), carbon nanotubes, network, transistor	2018-05-01 00:00:00

Also, U-shaped assembly lines have been shown as the intelligent way of producing homogeneous products in large quantities by reducing the workforce need thanks to the crossover workstations. As an innovative idea, we address the mixed-model parallel U-shaped assembly line design which combines the flexibility of mixed-model lines with the efficiency of U-shaped lines and parallel lines. The multi-line stations utilised in between two adjacent lines provide extra efficiency with the opportunity of assigning tasks into workstations in different combinations. The new line configuration is defined and characterised in details and its advantages are explained. A heuristic solution approach is proposed for solving the problem. The proposed approach considers the model sequences on the lines and seeks efficient balancing solutions for their different combinations. An explanatory example is also provided to show the sophisticated structure of the studied problem and explain the running mechanism of the proposed approach.

Because of the high purchasing and processing costs of additive manufacturing machines, the planning and scheduling of parts to be processed on these machines play a vital role in reducing operational costs, providing service to customers with less price and increasing the profitability of companies which provide such services. However, this topic has not yet been studied in the literature, although cost functions have been developed to calculate the average production cost per volume of material for additive manufacturing machines. In an environment where there are machines with different specifications (i.e. production time and cost per volume of material, processing time per unit height, set-up time, maximum supported area and height, etc.) and parts in different heights, areas and volumes, allocation of parts to machines in different sets or groups to minimize the average production cost per volume of material constitutes an interesting and challenging research problem. This paper defines the problem for the first time in the literature and proposes a mathematical model to formulate it. The mathematical model is coded in CPLEX and two different heuristic procedures, namely ‘best-fit’ and ‘adapted best-fit’ rules, are developed in JavaScript. Solution-building mechanisms of the proposed heuristics are explained stepwise through examples. A numerical example is also given, for which an optimum solution and heuristic solutions are provided in detail, for illustration. Test problems are created and a comprehensive experimental study is conducted to test the performance of the heuristics. Experimental tests indicate that both heuristics provide promising results. The necessity of planning additive manufacturing machines in reducing processing costs is also verified.

This is achieved hierarchically. The workload of the most heavily loaded workstation is minimised, followed by the workload of the second most heavily loaded workstation and so on. This study contributes to knowledge by examining the application of the lexicographic bottleneck objective on mixed-model lines, where more than one product model is produced in an inter-mixed sequence. The main characteristics of the lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly line balancing problem are described with numerical examples. Another contribution of the study is the methodology used to deal with the complex structure of the problem. Two effective meta-heuristic approaches, namely artificial bee colony and tabu search, are proposed. The parameters of the proposed meta-heuristics are optimised using response surface methodology, which is a well-known design of experiments technique, as a unique contribution to the expert and intelligent systems literature. Different from the common tendency in the literature (which aims to optimise one parameter at a time), all parameters are optimised simultaneously. Therefore, it is shown how a complex production planning problem can be solved using sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques with optimised parameters. The methodology used for parameter setting can be applied to other metaheuristics for solving complex problems in practice. The performances of both algorithms are assessed using well-known test problems and it is observed that both algorithms find promising solutions. Artificial bee colony algorithm outperforms tabu search in minimising the number of workstations while tabu search shows a better performance in minimising the value of lexicographic bottleneck objective function.

However, dynamism in product demands and growing interest in customized products force companies to adapt more flexible as well as efficient production systems. On the other hand, parallel lines are becoming quite popular as these lines provide extra efficiency with the opportunity of utilizing multi-line workstations. We apply the parallel line configuration idea to the U-shaped mixed-model assembly line system to have a more efficient as well as flexible production environment, for the first time in the literature. The proposed line system combines the advantages of U-shaped lines, parallel lines, and mixed-model lines. The new line configuration is characterized and defined in detail and the advantages of the proposed line system are explained through numerical examples.

Lexicographic bottleneck assembly line balancing problem is a recently introduced problem which aims at obtaining a smooth workload distribution among workstations. This is achieved hierarchically. The workload of the most heavily loaded workstation is minimised, followed by the workload of the second most heavily loaded workstation, and so on. We address this problem on mixed-model lines, where more than one model of a product is produced in an intermixed sequence, and introduce Lexicographic Bottleneck Mixed-model Assembly Line Balancing Problem (LB-MALBP) for the first time in the literature. That is the major contribution of this paper. Main characteristics of the problem are exhibited through a numerical example and a new artificial bee colony algorithm, which consumes quite reasonable CPU time, is developed for the solution of the problem. Solution procedures of the algorithm are explored illustratively. The performance of the algorithm is assessed using derived well-known test problems in this domain and promising results are observed.

Model variations are considered on two-sided lines located in parallel to each other; and the problem of balancing mixed-model parallel two-sided lines is defined and explained. The requirement of considering station merging procedure along with the line balancing problem is discussed. An agent based ant colony optimisation algorithm is developed to solve the problem. A numerical example is also given to describe the problem visually and to explain the proposed method systematically. Test cases are solved using proposed approach and the results indicate that defined line system has advantages over separately balanced mixed-model two-sided lines and the proposed algorithm outperforms other common six heuristics of the line balancing found in the literature.

Efficiency of an assembly line is one of the most important of these factors since assembly lines are generally constructed as the last stage of the entire production system. Parallel two-sided assembly line (PTAL) system is a new research domain in academia though PTALs have been utilised to produce large sized products such as automobiles, trucks, and buses in industry for many years. PTALs carry practical advantages of both parallel assembly lines and two-sided assembly lines. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new genetic algorithm based (GA) approach for balancing more than one two-sided assembly line constructed in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first attempt to solve this problem with a GA based approach in the literature. The proposed GA approach is also illustrated with an example to explain the procedures of the algorithm. Preliminary results are promising and indicate that GA has a potential to solve parallel two-sided assembly line balancing problems (PTALBPs) effectively in a reasonable time.

Meta-heuristics help both academics and practitioners to get not only feasible but also near optimal solutions where obtaining a solution for the relevant problem is not possible in a reasonable time using traditional optimisation techniques. Ant colony optimisation algorithm is inspired from the collective behaviour of ants and one of the most efficient meta-heuristics in solving combinatorial optimisation problems. One of the main application areas of ant colony optimisation algorithm is assembly line balancing problem. In this paper, we first give the running principle of ant colony optimisation algorithm and then review the applications of ant colony optimisation based algorithms on assembly line balancing problems in the literature. Strengths and weaknesses of proposed algorithms to solve various problem types in the literature have also been discussed in this research. The main aim is to lead new researches in this domain and spread the application areas of ant colony optimisation techniques in various aspects of line balancing problems. Existing researches in the literature indicate that ant colony optimisation methodology has a promising solution performance to solve line balancing problems especially when integrated with other heuristic and/or meta-heuristic methodologies.

This has led to rising rates of new product introduction and turbulent demand patterns across product mixes. As a result, manufacturing enterprises were facing mounting challenges to be agile and responsive to cope with market changes, so as to achieve the competitiveness of producing and delivering products to the market timely and cost-effectively. This paper introduces a currency-based iterative agent bidding mechanism to effectively and cost-efficiently integrate the activities associated with production planning and control, so as to achieve an optimised process plan and schedule. The aim is to enhance the agility of manufacturing systems to accommodate dynamic changes in the market and production. The iterative bidding mechanism is executed based on currency-like metrics; each operation to be performed is assigned with a virtual currency value and agents bid for the operation if they make a virtual profit based on this value. These currency values are optimised iteratively and so does the bidding process based on new sets of values. This is aimed at obtaining better and better production plans, leading to near-optimality. A genetic algorithm is proposed to optimise the currency values at each iteration. In this paper, the implementation of the mechanism and the test case simulation results are also discussed.

The first part of the problem is to configure the SC given that manufacturers have one or more options to perform every supplying, assembly, and delivery stage. Then, a certain amount of inventory should be placed on each stage to ensure products are delivered to customers just in the stages’ service time. We tested a new nature-inspired swarm-based metaheuristic called Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) which imitates some of the processes that happen in nature among the water drops of a river and the soil of the river bed. The proposed approach is based on the creation of artificial water drops, which adapt to their environment to find the optimum path from a river/lake to the sea. This idea is embedded into our proposed algorithm to find the cheapest cost of supplying components, assembling, and delivering products subject to the stages’ service time. We tested our approach using a Notebook SC, used widely as test bed in literature. We compared the results computed by other approaches and provided some metrics as well as graphical proof of convergence.	Safety Stock, Swarm Intelligence, Water Drop Intelligence	2012

For a supply chain, there may be multiple suppliers that could supply the same components as well as optional manufacturing plants that could assemble the subassemblies and the products. Each of these options is differentiated by a lead-time and cost. Given all the possible options, the supply chain design problem is to select the options that minimise the total supply chain cost while keeping the total lead-times within required delivery due dates. This work proposes an algorithm based on Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation as an effective meta-heuristic method for solving multi-objective supply chain design problems. An experimental example and a number of variations of the example are used to test the algorithm and the results reported using a number of comparative metrics. Parameters affecting the performance of the algorithm are investigated.	Supply chain configuration,Multi-objective optimisation,Ant colony,Meta-heuristics	2011-05-01 00:00:00

T. Goh	An iterative agent bidding mechanism for responsive manufacturing	Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence	School of Engineering, Computing and Mathematics, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom	D.Z.Zhang@exeter.ac.uk	In today's market, the global competition has put manufacturing businesses in great pressures to respond rapidly to dynamic variations in demand patterns across products and changing product mixes. To achieve substantial responsiveness, the manufacturing activities associated with production planning and control must be integrated dynamically, efficiently and cost-effectively. This paper presents an iterative agent bidding mechanism, which performs dynamic integration of process planning and production scheduling to generate optimised process plans and schedules in response to dynamic changes in the market and production environment. The iterative bidding procedure is carried out based on currency-like metrics in which all operations (e.g. machining processes) to be performed are assigned with virtual currency values, and resource agents bid for the operations if the costs incurred for performing them are lower than the currency values. The currency values are adjusted iteratively and resource agents re-bid for the operations based on the new set of currency values until the total production cost is minimised. A simulated annealing optimisation technique is employed to optimise the currency values iteratively. The feasibility of the proposed methodology has been validated using a test case and results obtained have proven the method outperforming non-agent-based methods.

This problem is made difficult by the complexity of supply chain networks coupled with the complexity of individual manufacturing systems within supply chains. Current systems such as manufacturing execution systems (MES), supply chain management (SCM) systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems do not provide adequate facilities for addressing this problem. This paper presents an approach that would enable manufacturing organisations to dynamically and cost-effectively integrate, optimise, configure, simulate, restructure and control not only their own manufacturing systems but also their supply networks, in a co-ordinated manner to cope with the dynamic changes occurring in a global market. This is realised by a synergy of two emerging manufacturing concepts: Agent-based agile manufacturing systems and e-manufacturing. The concept is to represent a complex manufacturing system and its supply network with an agent-based modelling and simulation architecture and to dynamically generate alternative scenarios with respect to planning, scheduling, configuration and restructure of both the manufacturing system and its supply network based on the coordinated interactions amongst agents.

Using the Lyapunov method and graph theory, it is proved that the controller can guarantee a group of spacecraft to track the time-varying reference attitude. Further, the tracking error can be adjusted by designers to satisfy different requirements of control accuracy. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the designed control law is successful in achieving high tracking performance, even in the presence of unknown external disturbance torque, unknown inertia matrices and switching interaction topology among spacecraft.

Then, a subspace method for estimating 3D egomotion from optical flow computed is proposed. The algorithm of optical flow is robust and reliable to the large motion, which is very important to recover the 3D egomotion parameters. Based on the flow velocity computed from image sequence, the subspace method is carried out in three steps using three sets of equations derived from nonlinear equation of motion perspective. At first, the translational direction of the observer's motion is recovered by searching a candidate over a discrete space to minimize a residual function. Once the translation has been estimated, the rotation components of the observer's motion can been resolved from the second set of equations by using the least square optimization. At last, the relative depth map of the scene is recovered using the third set of equations. Promising quantitative results are reported from experiments with simulated data and synthetic image.	structure from motion,subspace theory,optical flow field,dynamic scene analysis	2006-01-01 00:00:00

Their ability to achieve a speedy development with equity has intrigued many economists who attempted to understand the drive of growth.

Contrary to the Sequential Information Arrival Hypothesis (SIAH), most of the Chinese bank stocks do not exhibit significant lead-lag relations between news and volatility. However, there is substantial evidence that news is strongly correlated with return volatility in all the stocks, consistent with the Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis (MDH). Further analysis based on news sentiment scores suggests that positive news arrivals influence return volatility more strongly, compared with negative news. In addition, there is some evidence indicating that news arrivals contribute to the persistence in return volatility.

We find evidence of a positive association between sustainability engagement and stock returns, suggesting firms’ sustainability news release in favour of the market. Although volatility persistence can largely be explained by news flows, the results show that sustainability news release has the significant and largest drop in volatility persistence, followed by popularity in Google search engine and the general news. Sustainability news release is found to affect positively stock return volatility.

By using firm-level data from big data matching out of China’s Customs Database and Chinese Industrial Enterprise Database, we study the foreign market entry order strategy of the Chinese exporters and assess the role of credit constraints in the process of internationalization. The results confirm the negative effect of credit constraints on firms’ exporting behavior and entry-time decision. Firms with less credit constraints are more likely to be a pioneer in the foreign market, and those severely credit constrained firms are prevented from doing so because they lack sufficient liquidity. Our robustness tests with different product categories and ownership confirm the evidence. It is also found that a firm’s choice decision for being a pioneer or a follower in exporting each new product-market combination is jointly determined by the firm-level and host-country-level characteristics, and that firms with larger scale, higher productivity, lower production costs and more intense competition are more likely to be pioneers. We also find that the entry timing decision of the followers is influenced by the pioneers’ performance and product category. The results further confirm the existence of crowding out effect and spillover effect between pioneers and followers, and have important policy implications for China’s further financial (credit) market reform and for internationalizing Chinese MNEs.

These developments have sparked intense debate on the potential of RMB internationalization and its pros and cons. In view of these developments, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of the RMB in both the spot and NDF markets since 2005 by examining the role and significance of the RMB NDF in the price discovery process and in predicting the volatility dynamics of the RMB markets. The results indicate that asymmetric volatility effects are significant for several NDF contract maturities and the spot-NDF correlations are significantly time-varying. Moreover, shocks to the volatility levels are highly persistent. Causality tests on the spot and NDF volatilities further suggest that the NDF markets impact the future fluctuations of the spot market, but the spot market does not have predictive power for the volatility of the NDF markets. Public information flows are found to have a significantly positive impact on the spot-forward conditional correlations. These findings have important implications for market linkages and effective hedging strategies.	Chinese renminbi,Price discovery,Volatility,Forward markets	2018-05-01 00:00:00

We find evidence that the effect from democracy to human development is nonlinear and varies depending on the levels of growth and democracy. The results confirm that the interaction effect of democracy-growth nexus has a positive impact on human development but the effect is sensitive to democratization process and the level of a country's economic development. It is established that democracy is more crucial in developed countries, whereas economic growth is vital in developing countries. The findings imply that the role of democracy in enhancing human development should not be overemphasized as economic growth is vital in the developing countries.

This study intends to examine the presence of heteroskedasticity and the leverage effect in the Chinese stock markets, and to capture the dynamics of conditional correlation between returns of China's stock markets and those of the U.S. in a bivariate VC-MGARCH framework. The results show that the leverage effect is significant in these markets during the sample period in 2000–2013, and the conditional correlation between mainland China's and the U.S. stock markets is quite low and highly volatile. The Chinese stock markets are found to be highly regimes persistent. These findings have important implication for investors seeking opportunity of portfolio diversification.

By using the new RavenPack News Analytics ⿿ Dow Jones Edition database that captures over 1200 types of firm-specific and macroeconomic news releases and their sentiment scores at high frequencies, we investigate the circumstances in which public news sentiment is related to the intraday volatility of the constituent stocks in the Dow Jones Composite Average (DJN 65). Two different conditionally heteroskedastic models are employed: the Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (FIGARCH) and the two-state Markov Regime-Switching GARCH (RS-GARCH) models. For most of the DJN 65 stocks, our results confirm the significant impact of firm-specific news sentiment on intraday volatility persistence, even after controlling for the potential effects of macroeconomic news. Compared with macroeconomic news sentiment, firm-specific news sentiment apparently accounts for a greater proportion of overall volatility persistence. Moreover, negative news has a greater impact on volatility than positive news. Furthermore, the results from the RS-GARCH model indicate that news sentiment accounts for a greater proportion of volatility persistence in the high-volatility regime (turbulent state) than in the low-volatility regime (calm state). In-sample forecasting performance and residual diagnostic tests suggest that FIGARCH generally outperforms RS-GARCH.

The objectives of this study are to make a comparative study by exploring the literature relating pass-through for import prices and domestic prices in Australia, China and India. In particular, we test whether the exchange rate pass-through to import prices is complete, estimate the pass-through to consumer price index (CPI) to investigate whether there is any association between the pass-through and the average inflation rate across these countries. A structural VAR model is used to examine the exchange rate pass-through over the period 1990–2011. The impulse responses indicate that exchange rates have less effect in the rising domestic prices in China and India. This will have important policy implication for the monetary authorities.

Although the option market is uniquely suited for trading on volatility information, there is little analysis on how trading activity in this market is linked to stock price volatility. The bulk of the discussion tends to focus on whether trading activity in the stock market is informative about stock volatility. To analyze the information in option trading activity for stock market volatility, a sample of 15 stocks with the highest option trading volume is selected. For each stock, it is noted that the trading activities in the put and call option markets have significant explanatory power for stock market volatility. In addition, the results indicate that the call option trading activity has a stronger impact on stock volatility compared with that of the put options. Our results demonstrate that information and sentiment in the option market is useful for the estimation of stock market volatility. Also, the significance of the effects of option trading activity on stock price volatility is observed to be comparable to that of stock market trading activity. Furthermore, the persistence and asymmetric effects in the volatility of some stocks tend to disappear once option trading activity is taken into account.

The first approach uses conventional methods such as sub-sampling, dummy variables, and overlapping moving window regression to capture exchange rate exposure. The second approach uses pre-specified determinants of exposure coefficients to analyze the time-variation of exchange rate exposure. For example, Allayannis (1997) suggests that currency beta is determined by export and import shares, and finds support for time-variation of exposure in some 4-digit level SIC industries. The third approach employs time-varying second moments to derive time-varying exchange rate exposure (see, for instance, Hunter, 2005; Lim, 2005). Hunter (2005) analyzes the time-varying exchange rate exposure of small and large firms using size-based portfolios of the Fama-French-type, and Lim (2005) derives both market and currency betas at country level, with allowance for non-orthogonality between risk factors. It is believed that the third approach is more appealing as the well-documented bivariate GARCH-type models are often employed to estimate the time-varying exchange rates conditional on available information. There are three models associated with this approach, namely, the VECH models; the BEKK models; and the Constant Conditional Correlation GARCH (CCC-GARCH) models. However, the VECH model is less popular because of the difficulty in maintaining positive definiteness of the variance and covariance matrix and other computational hindrance on convergence during estimation, while the CCC-GARCH model is too restrictive as the computed covariance between returns and exchange rate changes can be either negative or positive in all periods, depending on the sign of the constant conditional correlation coefficient. In reality, exchange rate changes may affect returns on stock index either positively and/or negatively in different time periods. Hence, it is inappropriate to assume time-constancy in the conditional correlation coefficient. In this paper, we adopt the general framework of conditional ICAPM proposed by Adler and Dumas (1983) and De Santis and Gerard (1998) to estimate the time varying currency betas and the time-varying market betas for nine developed and emerging countries. A trivariate BEKK-GARCH-type model is used to estimate the conditional variance and covariance of return variables using a set of daily data spanning from 5 January 1999 to 30 December 2005. In particular, we compute the time-varying currency betas and market betas using estimates of the conditional variance and covariance of returns from country stock index, world market portfolio and changes in exchange rate of the trading country. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that estimates such betas from a BEKK-GARCH-type specification based on daily returns. The main advantage of BEKK parameterization is that it guarantees the variance and covariance matrix to be positive definiteness during estimation, and the often alleged difficulty of interpreting parameters in BEKK models is not an issue. Our results indicate that currency betas are generally more volatile than that of the world market betas. In addition, currency betas in the emerging markets, such as Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, are more volatile than those in the developed markets. We also find some evidence of long-memory in the estimated currency betas. The findings have important implications for investment and hedging strategies.

It is often assumed that a firm’s future operating cash flows is proxied by its market value, and the exposure coefficient would be able to efficiently measure the impact of exchange rate changes on a firm’s return and its sensitivity to the changes. Recently, some studies begin to investigate whether exchange rate exposure is asymmetric between currency appreciations and depreciations. By far most existing studies on exchange rate exposure assume that the variances of a firm’s returns and exchange rates changes are time-invariant. In this paper, we assess empirically the validity of this assumption, and argue that the conveniently defined exchange rate exposure is inadequate for measuring the entire impact of exchange rate changes on a firm’s future operating cash flows in cases of time-varying variances. There are at least four alternative routes through which a firm’s returns are exposed to foreign exchange risks when the variances are time-variant	Exchange rate exposure; volatility spillovers; multivariate GARCH-M models; time-varying	2011-12-01 00:00:00

The empirical results show a dynamic effect of external shocks, implying that, even though regional integration appears to be deepening and accelerating, especially after the recent global financial crisis, the influence of US shocks on real output fluctuations in the East Asian region is still very strong. The effects of Chinese shocks show an increasing trend over time, but the impacts are still small and not comparable with those of US shocks. The world oil price shock has become increasingly important in influencing the stability of real output growth in the region. The results from variance decomposition and impulse response analysis confirm the findings. Even though Japanese firms have established production networks in East Asia through trade and investment, and China has also grown rapidly and become a key regional country, the results suggest that US influence in the region is still asymmetric and strong. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that shocks to the East Asian economies have become more regionally oriented.

Unfortunately, under unbalanced grid voltage, the conventional DPC (CDPC) scheme with the conventional definitions of active and reactive power cannot work well. In order to solve this problem, a new definition of the active power instead of the conventional one is proposed, discussed and used in this paper. As a result, good performance of the system is achieved and neither complicated calculation of a power compensation term nor positive/negative sequence extraction of grid voltages/currents are required. Then, a switching table based DPC strategy is designed based on the new definition of active power and conventional definition of reactive power. The corresponding switching table is suitable to achieve constant active power, constant reactive power and sinusoidal grid currents with very low total harmonic distortions (THDs). Simulation results are presented to confirm the theoretical study and the effectiveness of the proposed DPC with the new definition of active power (DPC-NP). The performance of the proposed DPC-NP is compared with that of the CDPC and that of the DPC with a new definition of reactive power (DPC-NQ).

This study investigated the dynamic expression of C5aR and C5L2 on neutrophils and their effects on neutrophil function. We found that sepsis patients displayed low expression levels of C5aR and C5L2 on neutrophils compared to healthy and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) subjects, and this expression pattern was correlated with disease severity. Additionally, the expression levels of C5aR and C5L2 were associated with the survival of sepsis patients. In vitro, the addition of C5a significantly reduced C5aR and C5L2 expression levels and IL-8 production in neutrophils from sepsis patients. Those findings suggest that the reduced expression of C5aRs was associated with the functional impairment of neutrophils and a poor prognosis for sepsis patients. Overall, these findings may help establish C5aRs expression levels as early markers to predict the severity of sepsis.	complement 5a, complement 5a receptor, neutrophil, prognosis, sepsis	2015-03-01 00:00:00

The initial inflammatory stage is quickly counterbalanced by an anti-inflammatory response, which compromises the immune system, leading to immune suppression. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis by inducing immunosuppression; however, the role of CD39+ Tregs in the process of sepsis is uncertain. This study investigated the dynamic levels of CD39+ Tregs and their phenotypic change in sepsis. Fourteen patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 42 patients with sepsis, and 14 healthy controls were enrolled. Sequential blood samples were used to analyze the numbers of CD39+ Tregs and their phenotypic changes. Survival at 28 days was used to evaluate the capacity of CD39+ Treg levels to predict mortality in sepsis patients. Increased expression of CD39+ Tregs was associated with a poor prognosis for sepsis patients, which suggests that CD39+ Treg levels could be used as a biomarker to predict the outcome of sepsis patients.

In this review, we retrospectively examine the history of immunological responses to HBV infection and summarize the current understanding of innate and adaptive immunity in the context of HBV-associated liver disease. Recent data indicate that the interaction between HBV and the host immune response not only substantially drives disease progression, but also significantly influences antiviral efficacy in HBV-infected individuals. Advances in the field have provided insight into the immunopathology of HBV infection. Based on the characteristics of host immune responses in patients with HBV infection, a ‘climbing slope hypothesis’ is proposed to suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the immune activity of the host may represent a complementary approach to antiviral drug treatment for the management of chronically HBV-infected patients.	antiviral therapy, disease progression, hepatitis B virus, host immunity, immune therapy	2009-10-01 00:00:00

However, it is unclear whether cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells could suppress HBV replication in CHB patients, especially if drug resistance develops. In this study, functional CIK cells were efficiently generated from 21 CHB patients and were transfused in an autologous manner. We found that CIK cells from the CHB patients displayed substantial proliferation and function. Administration of the CIK cells closely correlated with the decrease in the serum HBV load and improvement in liver function in some patients. The virological response rate in patients with baseline serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of > 40 U/L was higher than that in patients with baseline serum ALT levels of ≤ 40 U/L. Moreover, patients who had HBeAg loss or showed seroconversion generally had baseline serum ALT levels of > 40 U/L. No serious side effects were observed. This protocol represents an alternative immune therapeutic strategy for the disease.	Cytokine-induced killer cell,Hepatitis B virus,Chronic hepatitis B,Safety,Efficacy	2009-04-01 00:00:00

A pose lexicon comprises a set of semantic poses, a set of visual poses, and a probabilistic mapping between the visual and semantic poses. This paper assumes that both the visual poses and mapping are hidden and proposes a method to simultaneously learn a visual pose model that estimates the likelihood of an observed video frame being generated from hidden visual poses, and a pose lexicon model establishes the probabilistic mapping between the hidden visual poses and the semantic poses parsed from textual instructions. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two-level hidden Markov models. One level represents the alignment between the visual poses and semantic poses. The other level represents a visual pose sequence, and each visual pose is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to train a pose lexicon. With the learned lexicon, action classification is formulated as a problem of finding the maximum posterior probability of a given sequence of video frames that follows a given sequence of semantic poses, constrained by the most likely visual pose and the alignment sequences. The proposed method was evaluated on MSRC-12, WorkoutSU-10, WorkoutUOW-18, Combined-15, Combined-17, and Combined-50 action datasets using cross-subject, cross-dataset, zero-shot, and seen/unseen protocols.

Ogunbona;Zhengyou Zhang	Semantic Action Recognition by Learning a Pose Lexicon	Pattern Recognition	Microsoft Research, Redmond, Shenzhen, WA, China	zhang@microsoft.com	This paper proposes a semantic representation, pose lexicon, for action recognition. The lexicon is composed of a set of semantic poses, a set of visual poses and a probabilistic mapping between the visual and semantic poses. Specially, an action can be represented by a sequence of semantic poses extracted from an associated textual instruction. Visual frames of the action are considered to be generated from a sequence of hidden visual poses. To learn the lexicon, a visual pose model is learned from training samples by a Gaussian Mixture model to characterize the likelihood of an observed visual frame being generated by a visual pose. A pose lexicon model is also learned by an extended hidden Markov alignment model to encode the probabilistic mapping between hidden visual poses and semantic poses sequences. With the lexicon, action classification is formulated as a problem of finding the maximum posterior probability of a given sequence of visual frames that fits to a given sequence of semantic poses through the most likely visual pose and alignment sequences. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated on MSRC-12, WorkoutSU-10, WorkoutUOW-18, Combined-15 and Combined-17 action datasets using cross-subject, cross-dataset and zero-shot protocols.

The first, Visual Screen, uses an inexpensive technique to transform an ordinary screen into a touch screen using an ordinary camera. The setup is easy: position a camera so it can see the whole screen. The system calibration involves the detection of the screen region in the image, which determines the projective mapping between the image plane and the screen. In runtime, our system locates the tip pointer (fingertip in our current implementation) in the image and converts the image position to the cursor position on the screen. The second system, Visual Panel, extends the previous system for mobile applications. It employs an arbitrary quadrangle-shaped panel (e.g., an ordinary piece of paper) and a tip pointer as an intuitive, wireless and mobile input device. The system can accurately and reliably track the panel and the tip pointer. The panel tracking continuously determines the projective mapping between the panel at the current position and the display, which in turn maps the tip position to the corresponding position on the display. The system can fulfill many tasks such as controlling a remote large display, and simulating a physical keyboard. Users can naturally use their fingers or other tip pointers to issue commands and type texts. Furthermore, by tracking the 3D position and orientation of the visual panel, the system can also provide 3D information, serving as a virtual joystick, to control 3D virtual objects.

During the past 15 years, tremendous progress has been made due to the availability of data in unconstrained capture conditions (so-called ‘in-the-wild’) through the Internet, the effort made by the community to develop publicly available benchmarks, as well as the progress in the development of robust computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we survey the recent advances in real-world face detection techniques, beginning with the seminal Viola–Jones face detector methodology. These techniques are roughly categorized into two general schemes: rigid templates, learned mainly via boosting based methods or by the application of deep neural networks, and deformable models that describe the face by its parts. Representative methods will be described in detail, along with a few additional successful methods that we briefly go through at the end. Finally, we survey the main databases used for the evaluation of face detection algorithms and recent benchmarking efforts, and discuss the future of face detection.

The effect of expander isentropic efficiency and position on the performance of DCFI cycle is investigated. Six double-compression refrigeration cycles are studied in the paper. The results show that the DCFI cycle performs better than DCEI cycle when the throttle valve is used as the expansion device. The replacement of the throttle valve with the expander yields less coefficient of performance (COP) improvement for DCFI cycle compared with DCEI cycle, especially at low evaporating temperatures or high gas cooler outlet temperatures. The COP of the two cycles is nearly equivalent when the isentropic efficiency of the expansion processes reaches 1.0. The DCFI cycle with only one throttle valve replaced with an expander shows lower COP compared with the corresponding DCEI expander cycle. The replacement of the main throttle valve with an expander results in higher COP compared with the auxiliary throttle valve replacement in the DCFI cycle. The substitution throttle valve for expander in the DCFI cycle is not economical compared with DCEI cycle. Furthermore, the optimum gas cooler pressure, the optimum intermediate pressure and the mass flow rate ratio are also discussed in the paper.

The results showed that the optimum gas cooler pressure and optimum intermediate pressure of the flash intercooler cycles are lower than that of the external intercooler cycle. The use of an expander in the DCEI cycle leads to a decrease of the optimum gas cooler pressure and little variation of the optimum intermediate pressure. However, the replacement of the throttle valve with an expander in the DCFI cycle results in little variation of the optimal gas cooler pressure and an increase of the optimum intermediate pressure. The DCFI cycle outperforms the DCEI cycle under all the chosen operating conditions. The DCEIE cycle outperforms the DCFIE cycle when the evaporating temperature exceeds 0 °C or the gas cooler outlet temperature surpasses 35 °C. When the gas cooler exit temperature varies from 32 °C to 48 °C, the DCEI cycle, DCEIE cycle, DCFI cycle and DCFIE cycle yield averaged 4.6%, 29.2%, 12.9% and 22.3% COP improvement, respectively, over the basic cycle.

A test nozzle with a throat diameter of 2 mm was designed and developed. The influence of operating conditions on the choked flow characteristics, i.e., the pressure profile and mass flow rate under choked flow conditions are investigated. The results indicate that the choked flow occurs in the flow of subcritical refrigerant through nozzles under the normal working conditions of air-conditioners or heat pumps. The pressure drop near the throat is about 80% of the total pressure drop through the nozzle. The critical mass flux is about 19,800 ~ 24,000 kg/(s·m2). The critical mass flow rate increases with increasing the upstream pressure and subcooling. Furthermore, the relative errors between the model predictions and the experimental results for the critical mass flux are also presented. It is found that the deviations of the predictions for homogeneous equilibrium model and Henry-Fauske model from the experimental values are −35% ~ 5% and 15% ~ 35%, respectively	refrigeration system; nozzle; choked flow; critical mass flow rate	2014-11-01 00:00:00

An improved ITE and the corresponding cycle are presented. In the new cycle, the ITE not only acts as an expansion device with work extraction, but also serves as an economizer with vapor injection. An increase of 20% in the isentropic efficiency can be attained for the improved ITE compared with the conventional ITE owing to the reduction of the friction losses of the rotor. The performance of the novel cycle is investigated based on energy and exergy analysis. A correlation of the optimum intermediate pressure in terms of ITE efficiency is developed. The improved ITE cycle increases the exergy efficiency by 1.4%–6.1% over the conventional ITE cycle, 4.6%–8.3% over the economizer cycle and 7.2%–21.6% over the base cycle. Furthermore, the improved ITE cycle is also preferred due to its lower exergy loss.	refrigeration cycle; turbo expander; optimum intermediate pressure; coefficient of performance (COP); exergy efficiency	2014-08-01 00:00:00

In this paper, the effect of the internal heat exchanger (IHE) on the performance of the ejector expansion transcritical CO2 refrigeration system is analyzed theoretically based on the first law of thermodynamics. The possible parameters affecting system efficiency are investigated. The variation of ejector entrainment ratio, pressure recovery, ejector efficiency and the coefficient of performance (COP) is obtained for the ejector expansion transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycles with and without IHE. It is found that the addition of IHE in the CO2 ejector refrigeration cycle increases the ejector entrainment ratio and the ejector efficiency, and decreases pressure recovery under the same gas cooler pressures. Unlike in a conventional throttle valve cycle, an IHE addition does not always improve the system performance in the ejector expansion cycle. Whether the energy efficiency of the ejector cycle by IHE can be improved depends on the isentropic efficiency level of the ejector. The utilization of IHE is only applicable in the cases of lower ejector isentropic efficiencies or higher gas cooler exit/evaporator temperatures for the ejector expansion system from the view of energy efficiency.

Most studies on ZSL utilize side information such as attributes or word vectors to bridge the relations between the seen classes and the unseen classes. However, existing approaches on ZSL typically exploit a shared space for each type of side information independently, which cannot make full use of the complementary knowledge of different types of side information. To this end, this paper presents an MBFA-ZSL approach to embed different types of side information as well as the visual feature into one shared space. Specifically, we first develop an algorithm named Multi-Battery Factor Analysis (MBFA) to build a unified semantic space, and then employ multiple types of side information in it to achieve the ZSL. The close-form solution makes MBFA-ZSL simple to implement and efficient to run on large datasets. Extensive experiments on the popular AwA, CUB, and SUN datasets show its superiority over the state-of-the-art approaches.

The basic idea to address this issue is transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen classes through mapping the visual feature to an embedding space spanned by class semantic information. The class semantic information can be obtained from human-labeled attributes or text corpus in an unsupervised fashion. Therefore, the embedding function from visual space to the embedding space is extremely important. However, the existing embedding approaches to ZSL mainly focus on aligning pairwise semantic consistency from heterogeneous spaces but ignore the intrinsic structure of the locally homogeneous isomorph. In order to preserve the locally visual structure in the embedding process, this paper proposes a Manifold regularized Cross-Modal Embedding (MCME) approach for ZSL by formulating the manifold constraint for intrinsic structure of the visual features as well as aligning pairwise consistency. The linear, closed-form solution makes MCME efficient to compute. Furthermore, rather than applying the embedding function learned from the seen classes directly, we also propose a new domain adaptation strategy to overcome the domain-shift problem during the knowledge transfer process. The MCME with the domain adaptation method is called MCME-DA. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of AwA and CUB validate the superiority and promise of MCME and MCME-DA.

Unlike most existing approaches where this is typically formulated as a regression problem or a time-series prediction problem, we take a different formulation to this problem by noting that these existing approaches fail to consider the potential relationships both among the consumers (consumer influence) and among the shops (competitions or collaborations). Taking this observation into consideration, we propose a new method for e-commerce business model mining and prediction, called EBMM, which combines regression with community analysis. The challenge is that the links in the network are typically not directly observed, which is addressed by applying information diffusion theory through the consumer-shop network. Extensive evaluations using Alibaba Group e-commerce data demonstrate the promise and superiority of EBMM to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of business model mining and prediction.

We sought to examine the role of total and processed red meat consumption on all-cause mortality among patients with cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) and lung, in order to test our hypothesis that red or processed meat was associated with overall mortality in these patients. Using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Los Angeles County, we conducted a case-only analysis to examine the association of red or processed meat consumption on mortality after 12 years of follow-up, using a diet history questionnaire. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. Of 601 UADT cancer cases and 611 lung cancer cases, there were 248 and 406 deaths, respectively, yielding crude mortality rates of 0.07 and 0.12 deaths per year. Comparing the highest with lowest quartile of red meat consumption, the adjusted HR was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.04-2.57) among UADT cancer cases; for red or processed meat, the adjusted HR was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.10-2.82). A dose-response trend was observed. A weaker association was observed with red meat consumption and overall mortality among lung cancer cases. In conclusion, this case-only analysis demonstrated that increased consumption of red or processed meats was associated with mortality among UADT cancer cases and WAS weakly associated with mortality among lung cancer cases.

We propose near-term as well as long-term solutions for cooperative problem solving that progressively enhances the functionality of database systems by synthesizing appropriate abstractions and techniques. Furthermore, we identify problems, such as agent capability modeling that require further research to address the most general form of cooperative problem solving.

In a previous genome project, in silico analysis predicted an AT-rich region in each chromosome as putative centromere regions. Here, we identified a centromere position in each chromosome by ChIP-on-chip analysis using an anti-CENP-A antibody. The identified centromeres were of the regional type, about 2–3 kb in length and contained no consensus or repeat elements. Centromeres in primitive eukaryotic plant cells may have originated from these regional type centromeres.

It is thus likely that the organelle transcription is coordinated with its proliferation cycle. However, this possibility has not extensively been explored to date, because in most plant cells there are many mitochondria and chloroplasts that proliferate asynchronously. It is generally believed that the gene transfer from the organellar to nuclear genome has enabled nuclear control of the organelle functions during the evolution of eukaryotic plant cells. Nevertheless, no significant relationship has been reported between the organelle transcriptome and the host cell cycle even in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. While the organelle proliferation cycle is not coordinated with the cell cycle in vascular plants, in the unicellular red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae that contains only one mitochondrion, one chloroplast, and one nucleus per cell, each of the organelles is known to proliferate at a specific phase of the cell cycle. Here, we show that the expression of most of the organelle genes is highly coordinated with the cell cycle phases as well as with light regimes in clustering analyses. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between the gene expression profiles in the mitochondrion and chloroplast, resulting in the identification of a network of functionally related genes that are co-expressed during organelle proliferation.	cell cycle; clustering analysis; Cyanidioschyzon; organelle; transcriptome	2012-04-01 00:00:00

However, the transfer of chloroplast genes into the nuclear genome is a prerequisite in this scheme, although it should not have been established during the very early phase of chloroplast evolution. We recently demonstrated in a primitive red alga that the plastid-derived Mg-protoporphyrin IX activates nuclear DNA replication (NDR) through the stabilization of a G1 cyclin, which coordinates the timing of organelle and NDR. This mechanism apparently does not involve any transcriptional regulation in the nucleus, and could have been established prior to gene transfer events. However, a retrograde signal mediating light-responsive gene expression may have been established alongside gene transfer, because essential light sensing and regulatory systems were originally incorporated into plant cells by the photosynthetic endosymbiont. In this short article, we discuss the origins, early days and evolution of the plastid retrograde signal(s).	cell cycle, checkpoint, chloroplast, DNA replication, nuclear gene transfer, retrograde signal, tetrapyrrole,transcription	2012-01-01 00:00:00

Although global use of low-carbon technology is a solution, consideration of economic consequences is important to promote future technology development and use. Photovoltaic (PV) solar power system is a promising renewable technology that carries climate mitigation expectations. We conducted a value chain analysis to evaluate the economic effect of the manufacture and use of silicon PV solar power system worldwide. We quantitatively reviewed the flow of manufacturing and installation for cells, modules, and facilities (e.g., inverters) related to Japan, and estimated the retrospectively induced economic costs for Japan and other developed and developing countries. Material, equipment, labor, utility, transportation, and business operation costs were studied in detail at different manufacturing and installation stages. This unique evaluation methodology quantified economic costs from an international perspective. The retrospectively induced economic effect of 2014 PV solar power system sales in Japan (induced by cell module and system production by Japanese companies and increased domestic use) was 1.6 trillion Japanese yen worldwide, of which 63% was attributable to Japan, 10% to other developed countries, and 27% to developing countries. The economic effect in Japan in terms of equipment cost and installation stage was 37% and 71% of the total effect, which was particularly high. Further technical improvement, cost reduction, and improvement in inverter and manufacturing equipment reliability are important to capitalize Japan's strengths. Currently, Japan's involvement in the manufacturing of cells and modules is small. Therefore, both technical innovation and cost reduction are necessary. We present new methodology to obtain inputs into policy development for further research, development, and technology diffusion.

Methodologies that evaluate only CO2 emission and track emissions by process may not fully account for energy saving efforts such as using waste heat, generating power using byproduct gases, and energy management efforts applied over the whole mill rather than on a single process. Points of concern in the iron and steel industry are identified in the areas of calculating energy saving, determining CO2 emissions, and setting benchmarks.

It is particularly important in strategies to mitigate climate change. The evidence of great potential for cost-effective efficiency-derived reductions in industrial energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have prompted governments to implement numerous policies and measures aimed at improving their manufacturing industries’ energy efficiency. What can be learned from these many and varied initiatives? This paper provides foundation for policy analysis for enhancing energy efficiency and conservation in industry, by surveying more than 300 policies, encompassing about 570 measures, implemented by governments in IEA countries, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa. It outlines the measures’ main features, their incidence of use, and their connections with specific technical actions and key stakeholders (i.e., how and where measures affect the energy efficiency of industry). It also examines the key features underlying the measures’ success: (1) potential to reduce energy use and CO2 emissions cost-efficiently; (2) ease of policy development, execution and assessment and (3) ancillary societal effects.

There are various measures of industrial energy efficiency performance, with different purposes and applications. This paper explores different ways to measure energy efficiency performance (MEEP): absolute energy consumption, energy intensity, diffusion of specific energy-saving technology and thermal efficiency. It discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and roles within policy frameworks. Policy makers should consider the suitability of MEEP based on criteria such as reliability, feasibility and verifiability. The limitations of both energy intensity and necessity of broader all-inclusive indicators and technology diffusion indicators are also discussed. A case study on Japan's iron and steel industry illustrates the critical role of proper boundary definitions for a meaningful assessment of energy efficiency in industry. Depending on the boundaries set for the analysis, the energy consumption per ton of crude steel ranges from 16 to 21 GJ. This paper stresses the importance of a proper understanding of various methods to assess energy efficiency, and the linkage with policy objectives and frameworks. Possible next steps for improvement of MEEP, such as database development, were also discussed.	Energy efficiency indicator,Steel industry,Boundary definitions	2008-08-01 00:00:00

One way to redress the balance between a person and the flood is a computer-based recommender system, and many Web sites use such systems. These systems on a Web site work for similar items. However, the field of personal activity is not limited to handling one kind of knowledge or one Web site, but also involves off-line activities in the real world. To handle personal off-line activity, LifeLog was proposed as a method to record it, but the main purpose of LifeLog is to record a personal history. The uses of such a history are still being studied. We have developed a recommender system that captures personal context from a history of personal online and offline activities, treats information on Web sites as a large set of context, and discovers and extends the overlaps of personal activities and Web sites, then recommends information located in the Web sites. The aim of the system is to allow a person to enjoy waves of information again.

With this perspective, we defined semantic structure as the organization of problem-solving systems. Semantic structure transition with elapsed time reflects how and what knowledge is used to solve a problem. Based on this argument, we constructed two systems for a semantic structure. The first system was designed to construct and manage the semantic structure, and the second was designed to derive the semantic structure transitions.	information sharing system, semantic structure transition,topic detection, document stream processing	2005-01-01 00:00:00

A new parameter-dependent sector condition is proposed to deal with the input saturation in SOF control context. Based on a judicious use of Finsler’s lemma in fuzzy Lyapunov control framework, new design conditions guaranteeing the existence of a stabilizing controller are recast as an LMI-based optimization with additional slack variables. These extra variables offer more flexibility to reduce the design conservatism. In particular, the proposed method requires neither special constraints on the state-space system matrices nor linear matrix equalities, which are hard to be satisfied. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the interests of the new control method.

The terminal neural controller including a perturbed fuzzy neural network (PFNN) is the main controller and the robust compensator is designed to eliminate the effect of the approximation error introduced by the PFNN upon the system stability. The PFNN is used to approximate an unknown nonlinear term of the system dynamics and perturbed asymmetric membership functions are used to handle rule uncertainties when it is hard to exactly determine the grade of membership functions. In additional, Lyapunov stability theory is used to discuss the parameter learning and system stability of the INTSMC system. Finally, the proposed INTSMC system is applied to an inverted pendulum and a voice coil motor actuator. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed INTSMC system can achieve favorable tracking performance and is robust against parameter variations in the plant.

It is not known how the brain adapts to the varying levels of discrimination required in different behavioral contexts. In the present study, we investigated whether the stimulus selectivity of neuronal responses in the monkey inferotemporal cortex, which is the final unimodal stage in the ventral visual pathway, changes with the varying levels of discrimination required for different task conditions. Responses of each inferotemporal cell to the same set of nine object images were examined in two different task conditions. The task alternated between coarse and fine discriminations in the first experiment, and the rule alternated between categorization and individual object identification in the second experiment. Despite these changes in the task requirements and the resulting differences in the monkeys' behavior, we found that the responses of inferotemporal cells were largely unchanged in both experiments. Our results suggest that representation of object images in the inferotemporal cortex is stable and rather insensitive to these kinds of shifts in behavioral context. Neuronal adaptations to behavioral context may occur downstream of the inferotemporal cortex.	monkey,visual cortex,inferotemporal cortex,object discrimination,stimulus selectivity,task dependence	2006-11-01 00:00:00

What are the functional roles of the column structure in the inferotemporal cortex? Selectivity of cells within a column is similar but not identical. If we emphasize the similarity among cells within a column, we can regard the columns as units for description of object features. The variety of stimulus selectivity in a column may work as a tool to disregard subtle changes in input images when the system is directed to invariant recognition. Alternatively, if we emphasize the differences in selectivity of cells within a column, the columns can be compared to differential amplifiers, each of which represents variety within a group of features. The enormous number of objects present in nature can be efficiently described by combining outputs of the multiple differential amplifiers in the inferotemporal cortex. The two modes may work in parallel, with a graded balance changing according to the behavioral context. Determining whether or not these hypotheses are valid will require further studies.	amplifiers,cercopithecidae,exanthema,neurons,optics,brain,diagnostic imaging,health disparity,object recognition,primary visual cortex	2003-02-01 00:00:00

Theory predicts that honest signalling strategies will not always be evolutionarily stable in interspecific communication, yet to demonstrate such a transition of signalling modality between honesty and dishonesty in the wild would be difficult. An endocarp dimorphism has been found in Scaevola taccada fruits: a morph with a cork substrate that facilitates ocean current seed dispersal and a morph without the cork. Both types of fruit are covered with sugar-containing flesh, and are similar in size and colour to one another (at least from a human perspective). The apparent lack of external differences between morphotypes could potentially degrade mutualistic relations between the plant and seed-dispersing birds because the presence of a cork could lower the fruit's nutritional value. Thus, unless seed dispersers can discriminate between the different types of fruit, this system may provide an example of a transition between honest and dishonest signalling. We examined S. taccada fruit and leaf colours from an avian visual perspective. Even though the fruits and leaves were different in colour from one another to birds, there was no perceivable difference in the colours between fruit morphotypes. Therefore, fruit colour is not an honest indicator of reward to seed dispersers. Further, we propose an adoption of a statistical method in avian visual modelling studies that avoids the common statistical errors, such as violation of the congruence principle.

Evidence from Japanese Manufacturing Industries	Quantitative Analysis of Newly Evolving Patterns of International Trade: Fragmentation, Offshoring of Activities, and Vertical Intra-industry Trade	Interdisciplinary Studies Center Institute of Developing Economics, Chiba, Japan	kiyoyasu_tanaka@ide.go.jp	An increasing number of manufacturers are shifting some stages of the production process offshore. This study investigates the effects of offshoring on productivity in Japanese manufacturing industries for the period 1988-2004. Material offshoring, as measured by an import share of intermediate material inputs, has steadily increased during the period, with a pronounced increase in offshoring to Asian countries. In a wide range of specifications, we find significantly positive correlations between material offshoring and productivity at the industry level. The estimates are particularly robust for offshoring to Asia. These results suggest that Japanese manufacturing firms have developed an extensive international division of labor in East Asia, which in turn may have enhanced domestic productivity. In contrast, service offshoring, as measured by an import ratio of service inputs, is not associated with industry-level productivity. We find a positive correlation between offshoring and productivity only for information services, suggesting that in this segment, offshoring offers potential benefits.

Using census data on formal and informal sectors in Cambodia, we document that 96.6 per cent of non-farm establishments do not formally register with the government, and their sales accounted for 76.6 per cent of total sales in 2011. Estimating their past sales from changes in nighttime light for 1993–2010, we find that both formal and informal firms increased their estimated sales. The share of informal sales increased from 68.8 per cent in 1993 to 76.6 per cent in 2011, suggesting that the informal sector increased quantitatively in both absolute and relative terms over time.

Using data on Japanese outward FDI, we define firms conducting HFDI or PFDI as those Japanese firms that maintain production affiliates only in the U.S. or Mexico, respectively. The firms for CFDI are defined as having production affiliates in both the U.S. and Mexico. The theoretical illustration shows that the CFDI firms should have the highest productivity when trade costs between the U.S. and Mexico are low. By carefully disentangling firms’ self-selection effects from learning-by-investing effects, we find some evidence consistent with this hypothesis for a period of relatively low trade costs. Our results indicate the importance of trade costs in developing countries with neighboring markets in attracting foreign investment by highly productive multinational firms.

We demonstrate that our adapted model is able to replicate important dimensions of the in-sample moments conditioned in our estimation strategy and does a reasonable job in external model validation tests. We can replicate activity under an economic period with a far different level of FDI barriers than was conditioned upon in our estimation sample.

Rather, US MNE activity is substantially higher in the skilled-labor-abundant country while total affiliate sales of Japanese MNE are not related to skill endowments.

This paper provides an empirical assessment on this argument by exploring a link between service-sector performance and manufacturing productivity in Japan for the period 1980-2005. Assuming that an improvement in producer services is measured with errors by a price deflator growth of service outputs, I propose an estimation framework in which an observed productivity depends partly on the performance of service sectors weighted by service-input intensities. Robust to a wide range of specifications and alternative indicators of services upgrading, I find little evidence that the service sectors contributed to productivity growth of the manufacturing sector. Thus, my findings do not support the claim that the upgrading of producer services improves manufacturing competitiveness.	 Producer Services; Service Sector; Productivity; Japan	2009-01-01 00:00:00

Using the Japanese Census of Logistics, this paper examines the extent to which transport distance and time affect freight costs across shipping modes, commodity groups, and prefecture pairs. The results show substantial heterogeneity in transport costs and time across shipping modes. Consistent with an iceberg formulation of transport costs, distance has a significantly positive effect on freight costs by air transportation. However, I find the puzzling results that business enterprises are likely to pay more for short-distance shipments by truck, ship, and railroad transportation. As a plausible explanation, I discuss aggregation bias arising from freight-specific premiums for timely, frequent, and small-batch shipments.

The precise mechanisms that cause the selective death of motor neurons remain unclear, but a growing body of evidence suggests that glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity has been considered to play an important role in the mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Reductions in glutamate transporter GLT1 have been reported in animal models of ALS and the motor cortex and spinal cord of ALS patients. However, it remains unknown whether the reduction in GLT1 has a primary role in the induction of motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Here, we generated conditional knockout mice that lacked GLT1 specifically in the spinal cord by crossing floxed-GLT1 mice and Hoxb8-Cre mice. Hoxb8-Cre/GLT1flox/flox mice showed motor deficits and motor neuron loss. Thus, loss of the glial glutamate transporter GLT1 is sufficient to cause motor neuron death in mice.

This area has recently attracted a surge of interest in psychiatry because studies have reported the pathological activation of the habenula in patients with major depression and in animal models. The LHb plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of depression; however, how habenular neurons are activated to cause various depression symptoms, such as reduced motivation and sleep disturbance, remain unclear. We hypothesized that dysfunctional astrocytes may cause LHb hyperactivity due to the defective uptake activity of extracellular glutamate, which induces depressive-like behaviors. We examined the activity of neurons in habenular pathways and performed behavioral and sleep analyses in mice with pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the activity of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 in the LHb. The habenula-specific inhibition of GLT-1 increased the neuronal firing rate and the level of c-Fos expression in the LHb. Mice with reduced GLT-1 activity in the habenula exhibited a depressive-like phenotype in the tail suspension and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. These animals also displayed increased susceptibility to chronic stress, displaying more frequent avoidant behavior without affecting locomotor activity in the open-field test. Intriguingly, the mice showed disinhibition of rapid eye movement sleep, which is a characteristic sleep pattern in patients with depression. These results provide evidence that disrupting glutamate clearance in habenular astrocytes increases neuronal excitability and depressive-like phenotypes in behaviors and sleep.	astrocytes; depression; glutamate transporters; habenula; monoamines; rapid eye movement sleep	2014-12-01 00:00:00

Numerous studies have revealed the mechanisms of development of neural stem cells. However, the signaling pathways that govern the development of INPs are largely unknown. The cerebellum is suitable for examining this issue because cerebellar cortical inhibitory neurons such as basket and stellate cells are derived from small Pax2+ interneuronal progenitors. Here, we show that Sox2−/Pax2+ and Sox2+/Pax2− progenitors, 2 types of interneuronal progenitors of basket and stellate cells, exist in the cerebellar white matter (WM) and that the former arise from the latter during the first postnatal week. Moreover, RBP-J promotes the neurogenesis of stellate and basket cells by converting Sox2+/Pax2− interneuronal progenitors to more mature Sox2−/Pax2+ interneuronal progenitors. This study shows a novel RBP-J function that promotes INP differentiation.	Cerebellar development,Basket cell and stellate cell,Intermediate neural progenitor,RBP-J,Neurogenesis	2011-03-01 00:00:00

In this study, broad-band THz spectroscopy (0.2–12 THz) of aqueous solutions of urea was used to characterize the hydration state and the hydrogen bond structure of water around urea. Three low-frequency vibration modes of urea were found around 2, 4, and above 12 THz. After eliminating the contribution of these modes, the “urea-vibration-free” complex dielectric constant was decomposed into the relaxation modes of bulk water and the oscillation modes of water. When hydration water is defined to be reorientationally retarded relative to bulk, our analysis revealed that the hydration number is 1.9 independent of urea concentrations up to 5 M, and this number is in close agreement with that of water constrained by strong acceptor hydrogen bonds of urea oxygen. Regarding the hydrogen bond structure, it was found that the tetrahedral-like water structure is mostly preserved (though the hydrogen bond lifetime is significantly shortened) but the population of non-hydrogen-bonded water molecules fragmented from the network is markedly increased, presumably due to urea’s NH2 inversion. These experimental results point to the coexistence of apparently two contradictory aspects of urea: dynamical retardation (the kosmotropic aspect) by the −CO group and slight structural disturbance (the chaotropic aspect) by the −NH2 group.
